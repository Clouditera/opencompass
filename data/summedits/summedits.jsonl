FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the \n        Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during \n        the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's \n        history.\n            (2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County, Kentucky, on \n        February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency \n        through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and \n        commitment to the United States.\n            (3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham \n        Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.\n            (4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice \n        toward none and with charity for all.\n            (5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the \n        country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April 15, \n        1865.\n            (6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of \n        Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for \n        accomplishing the ``American dream'' through honesty, \n        integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.\n            (7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of \n        the birth of Abraham Lincoln.\n            (8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood \n        in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in \n        Washington, D.C.\n            (9) The so-called ``Lincoln cent'' was introduced in 1909 \n        on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the obverse \n        design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.\n            (10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the \n        talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to \n        design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting \n        a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.\n            (11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the ``Lincoln \n        cent'', there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the \n        original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing \n        mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial \n        in Washington, D.C.\n            (12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President \n        Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of \n        the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of \n        1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of \n        the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's life.\n\nSEC. 3. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.\n\n    (a) In General.--During the year 2009, the Secretary of the \nTreasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the following \ndesign specifications:\n            (1) Obverse.--The obverse of the 1-cent coin shall continue \n        to bear the Victor David Brenner likeness of President Abraham \n        Lincoln.\n            (2) Reverse.--The reverse of the coins shall bear 4 \n        different designs each representing a different aspect of the \n        life of Abraham Lincoln, such as--\n                    (A) his birth and early childhood in Kentucky;\n                    (B) his formative years in Indiana;\n                    (C) his professional life in Illinois; and\n                    (D) his presidency, in Washington, D.C.\n    (b) Issuance of Redesigned Lincoln Cents in 2009.--\n            (1) Order.--The 1-cent coins to which this section applies \n        shall be issued with 1 of the 4 designs referred to in \n        subsection (a)(2) beginning at the start of each calendar \n        quarter of 2009.\n            (2) Number.--The Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of \n        such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the \n        number of 1-cent coins that shall be issued with each of the \n        designs selected for each calendar quarter of 2009.\n    (c) Design Selection.--The designs for the coins specified in this \nsection shall be chosen by the Secretary----\n            (1) after consultation with the Abraham Lincoln \n        Bicentennial Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts; and\n            (2) after review by the Citizens Coinage Advisory \n        Committee.\n\nSEC. 4. REDESIGN OF REVERSE OF 1-CENT COINS AFTER 2009.\n\n    The design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after December \n31, 2009 shall bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln's \npreservation of the United States of America as a single and united \ncountry.\n\nSEC. 5. NUMISMATIC PENNIES WITH THE SAME METALLIC CONTENT AS THE 1909 \n              PENNY.\n\n    The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in 2009 with \nthe exact metallic content as the 1-cent coin contained in 1909 in such \nnumber as the Secretary determines to be appropriate for numismatic \npurposes\n\nSEC. 6.

REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.\n\n    (a) In General.--During the year 2009, the Secretary of the \nTreasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the following \ndesign specifications:\n            (1) Obverse.--The obverse of the 1-cent coin shall continue \n        to bear the Victor David Brenner likeness of President Abraham \n        Lincoln.\n            (2) Reverse.--The reverse of the coins shall bear 4 \n        different designs each representing a different aspect of the \n        life of Abraham Lincoln, such as--\n                    (A) his birth and early childhood in Kentucky;\n                    (B) his formative years in Indiana;\n                    (C) his professional life in Illinois; and\n                    (D) his presidency, in Washington, D.C.\n    (b) Issuance of Redesigned Lincoln Cents in 2009.--\n            (1) Order.--The 1-cent coins to which this section applies \n        shall be issued with 1 of the 4 designs referred to in \n        subsection (a)(2) beginning at the start of each calendar \n        quarter of 2009.\n            (2) Number.--The Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of \n        such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the \n        number of 1-cent coins that shall be issued with each of the \n        designs selected for each calendar quarter of 2009.\n    (c) Design Selection.--The designs for the coins specified in this \nsection shall be chosen by the Secretary----\n            (1) after consultation with the Abraham Lincoln \n        Bicentennial Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts; and\n            (2) after review by the Citizens Coinage Advisory \n        Committee.\n\nSEC. 4. REDESIGN OF REVERSE OF 1-CENT COINS AFTER 2009.\n\n    The design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after December \n31, 2009 shall bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln's \npreservation of the United States of America as a single and united \ncountry.\n\nSEC. 5. NUMISMATIC PENNIES WITH THE SAME METALLIC CONTENT AS THE 1909 \n              PENNY.\n\n    The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in 2009 with \nthe exact metallic content as the 1-cent coin contained in 1909 in such \nnumber as the Secretary determines to be appropriate for numismatic \npurposes\n\nSEC. 6. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the original Victor David \nBrenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic departure from \nprevious American coinage that should be reproduced, using the original \nform and relief of the likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins \nissued in 2009.", "summary": "Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial 1-Cent Currency Redesign Act - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, during 2009, to issue one-cent coins with the reverse side bearing four different designs representing different aspects of the life of Abraham Lincoln.", "label": 0, "original_summary": "Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial 1-Cent Coin Redesign Act - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, during 2009, to issue one-cent coins with the reverse side bearing four different designs representing different aspects of the life of Abraham Lincoln.", "edit_types": ["entity_modification"]}

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Federal Government has a responsibility to promote \n        the general welfare of the Nation by employing its resources to \n        remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the \n        acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for \n        families of lower income and by developing effective \n        partnerships with governmental and private entities to \n        accomplish these objectives.\n            (2) Based upon the status of the Kingdom of Hawaii as an \n        internationally recognized and independent sovereign and the \n        unique historical and political relationship between the United \n        States and Native Hawaiians, the Native Hawaiian people have a \n        continuing right to local autonomy in traditional and cultural \n        affairs and an ongoing right of self-determination and self-\n        governance that has never been extinguished.\n            (3) The authority of Congress under the Constitution of the \n        United States to legislate and address matters affecting the \n        rights of indigenous people of the United States includes the \n        authority to legislate in matters affecting Native Hawaiians.\n            (4) In 1921, in recognition of the severe decline in the \n        Native Hawaiian population, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes \n        Commission Act, 1920, which set aside approximately 200,000 \n        acres of the ceded public lands for homesteading by Native \n        Hawaiians, thereby affirming the special relationship between \n        the United States and the Native Hawaiians.\n            (5) In 1959, under the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for \n        the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union'', approved \n        March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States reaffirmed the \n        special relationship between the United States and the Native \n        Hawaiian people--\n                    (A) by transferring what the United States deemed \n                to be a trust responsibility for the administration of \n                the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of Hawaii, but \n                continuing Federal superintendence by retaining the \n                power to enforce the trust, including the exclusive \n                right of the United States to consent to land exchanges \n                and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission \n                Act, 1920, enacted by the legislature of the State of \n                Hawaii affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such \n                Act; and\n                    (B) by ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the \n                public lands formerly held by the United States, \n                mandating that such lands be held ``in public trust'' \n                for ``the betterment of the conditions of Native \n                Hawaiians, as defined in the Hawaiian Homes Commission \nAct, 1920'', and continuing Federal superintendence by retaining the \nexclusive legal responsibility to enforce this public trust.\n            (6) In recognition of the special relationship that exists \n        between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people, \n        Congress has extended to Native Hawaiians the same rights and \n        privileges accorded to American Indians and Alaska Natives \n        under the Native American Programs Act of 1974, the American \n        Indian Religious Freedom Act, the National Museum of the \n        American Indian Act, the Native American Graves Protection and \n        Repatriation Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, the \n        Native American Languages Act, the American Indian, Alaska \n        Native and Native Hawaiian Culture and Arts Development Act, \n        the Job Training and Partnership Act, and the Older Americans \n        Act of 1965.\n            (7) The special relationship has been recognized and \n        reaffirmed by the United States Congress in the area of \n        housing--\n                    (A) through the authorization of mortgage loans \n                insured by the Federal Housing Administration for the \n                purchase, construction, or refinancing of homes on \n                Hawaiian Home Lands under the National Housing Act;\n                    (B) by mandating Native Hawaiian representation on \n                the National Commission on American Indian, Alaska \n                Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing;\n                    (C) by the inclusion of Native Hawaiians in the \n                Native American Veterans' Home Loan Equity Act of 1993; \n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

\n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.
