The Lions scored first in the first quarter with a 23-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Buccaneers tied it up with a 38-yard field goal by Connor Barth, then took the lead when Aqib Talib intercepted a pass from Matthew Stafford and ran it in 28 yards. The Lions responded with a 28-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Detroit took the lead with a 36-yard touchdown catch by Calvin Johnson, and later added more points when Tony Scheffler caught an 11-yard TD pass. Tampa Bay responded with a 31-yard field goal just before halftime. The second half was relatively quiet, with each team only scoring one touchdown. First, Detroit's Calvin Johnson caught a 1-yard pass in the third quarter. The game's final points came when Mike Williams of Tampa Bay caught a 5-yard pass.  The Lions won their regular season opener for the first time since 2007",

Losman was immediately injured on the first offensive play of the game.  He would finish the series, but ended up on the bench for the rest of the game.  After New England took the lead with kicker Stephen Gostkowski's 24-yard field goal, rookie QB Trent Edwards played the rest of the game for Buffalo.  The Bills would get their only score of the game as RB Marshawn Lynch got an 8-yard TD run, and a Rian Lindell extra point put the Bills ahead surprisingly 7-3.  However, in the second quarter, the Patriots were able to open up their running game when Bills rookie standout Paul Posluszny was lost due to a broken arm. This left passing lanes open, and for the rest of the game, the Patriots dominated. QB Tom Brady's 8-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson and a 3-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss made it 17-7 at the half.  In the third quarter, New England continued its conquest with Brady's 4-yard TD pass to WR Jabar Gaffney and RB Sammy Morris' 4-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Patriots ended the day with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 45-yard TD pass.",

        "passage": "The French king, John II, had been held captive in England. The Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny set his ransom at 3\u00a0million\u00a0crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England. The French crown had been at odds with Navarre  since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power. Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations. In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity. Charles V succeeded him as king of France. On 7 May 1364, one month after the dauphin's accession and three days before his coronation as Charles V, the Navarrese suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Cocherel.",

        "passage": "From 1231, Goryeo was intermittently invaded by the Mongol Empire. During this time, Goryeo was controlled by a military regime led by the Choe family. In 1232 the government under the nominal king fled to Ganghwa Island, which Mongol horse riders were unable to land on, and resisted the Mongol invasion. Unfortunately because of its fragile foundation, Goryeo faced frequent rebellions. The 1258 rebellion resulted in the establishment of Ssangseong  and Dongnyeong Prefectures  by the Mongols. Unlike these rebels, the Sambyeolcho  were an organ of the military government. They were organized by the Choe family to maintain security. However, unlike the Choe private guards unit , the Sambyeolcho assumed public functions performed by police and combat forces, effectively replacing the Six Divisions of the military. In 1258, Choe Ui, the fourth of the Choe family, was overthrown by Kim Jun  using the Sambyeolcho. Kim Jun took a pro-Mongol policy and sent Crown Prince Wang Jeon to the Mongol Empire. At the same time, King Gojong and the crown prince approached the Mongols to restore power from Kim Jun. In 1268, however, Kim Jun was annihilated by the Sambyeolcho under the order of Im Yeon. The next year, Im Yeon's attempt to replace King Wonjong was reversed by the crown prince  with the help from the Mongol force. In 1270, Im Yeon's successor Im Yumu was killed by the pro-Mongol faction using the Sambyeolcho. It marked the end of the military regime.",

In the first quarter, New York took flight as QB Brett Favre completed an 18-yard TD pass to RB Leon Washington.  In the second quarter, the Chiefs tied the game as QB Tyler Thigpen completed a 19-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  The Jets would answer with Washington getting a 60-yard TD run.  Kansas City closed out the half as Thigpen completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Mark Bradley. In the third quarter, the Chiefs took the lead as kicker Connor Barth nailed a 30-yard field goal, yet New York replied with RB Thomas Jones getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Kansas City got the lead again as CB Brandon Flowers returned an interception 91 yards for a touchdown.  Fortunately, the Jets pulled out the win with Favre completing the game-winning 15-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles.

Kansas City would find themselves trailing in the first quarter as Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers completed a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Malcom Floyd, followed by a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Vincent Jackson. San Diego would add onto their lead in the second quarter with a 20-yard and a 39-yard field goal from kicker Nate Kaeding. The Chiefs would get onto the board in the third quarter with quarterback Matt Cassel completing a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Dwayne Bowe, but the Chargers kept their momentum going with Rivers finding running back Darren Sproles on a 58-yard touchdown pass. In the fourth quarter, San Diego sealed the win with Kaeding's 19-yard field goal and fullback Jacob Hester recovering a blocked punt in the end zone for a touchdown. With the loss, Kansas City went into their bye week at 1-6. Larry Johnson was suspended for two weeks after he made offensive comments about Todd Haley and made offensive comments about homosexuals on Twitter and in public.",

After a scoreless first quarter, Pittsburgh came out striking in the second quarter as quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completed an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller and a 52-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hines Ward.  The Browns immediately struck back as wide receiver Joshua Cribbs returned a kickoff 98&#160;yards for a touchdown. Pittsburgh would close out the half with a 32-yard field goal from kicker Jeff Reed. Cleveland tried to catch up as quarterback Derek Anderson completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to fullback Lawrence Vickers, yet the Steelers answered with a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Rashard Mendenhall.  Pittsburgh would then close the game out in the fourth quarter with Reed kicking a 39-yard field goal. With their 12th-straight win over the Browns, the Steelers improved to 4-2.  With the Ravens' loss to the Vikings, and the Bengals' loss to the Texans that same week, the Steelers are now tied with the Bengals at the top of the AFC North.",

        "passage": "Coming off their Bye Week, the Redskins avenged their Week 2 loss by defeating the Dallas Cowboys after a wild final minute of the fourth quarter which ended with a game-winning 47-yard field goal by kicker Nick Novak. With less than a minute left in the fourth quarter, Dallas kicker Mike Vanderjagt's field goal was blocked by newly signed Redskins cornerback Troy Vincent, and recovered by Redskins free safety Sean Taylor, who ran the ball down to the Dallas 45-yard line with no time remaining. During the runback by Taylor, Dallas offensive lineman Kyle Kosier was flagged for a 15-yard facemask penalty, which moved the ball down to the Cowboys 30-yard line.  The NFL Rulebook states that a game cannot end on a defensive penalty, thus, Washington was awarded one un-timed down. With the playclock at 0:00, Novak completed a 47-yard field goal to win the game, sending FedEx field into pandemoneum and improving the Redskins record to 3-5. Stats",

        "passage": "In 1344, Momchil, the independent Bulgarian ruler of the Rhodope and Aegean regions, whose army grew to 2,000 men, took an important role in the Byzantine civil war. While at first he supported John Kantakouzenos, from the spring of 1344 Momchil reneged, provoked by the aggression of the Ottoman allies. In June he defeated the Ottoman fleet near the Portogalos bay. According to sources, at night the Bulgarian ruler sent boats to burn the anchored Ottoman ships and soon after he defeated the army of Kantakouzenos at Mosynopolis. Probably the first local ruler to become aware of the impending Ottoman threat, Momchil unsuccessfully pleaded with the emperors of Bulgaria and Byzantium for help. Even though his troops continued the resistance in the Eastern Rhodopes, in May 1345 the Turks led by Umur Beg marched from Asia Minor and devastated Bulgarian territories driving away people and livestock. Soon after, on 7 July 1345, Ottoman forces under Umur Beg defeated Momchil's army in the battle of Peritor near his capital Xanthi. Sources attest that the independent ruler perished in the battle without leaving asuccessor, and with little political will or leadership left to counter the Ottoman invasion.",

In the first quarter, Carolina took the early lead with kicker John Kasay getting a 23-yard field goal. The Saints responded with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 25-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Panthers went back into the lead with Kasay nailing a 35-yard field goal. New Orleans would respond with Mare kicking a 28-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Carolina trailed as Saints FB Mike Karney got a 2-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Panthers tied the game with Carr completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith. Afterwards, Carolina sealed the win in the final seconds with Kasay nailing a 52-yard field goal as time ran out.",

        "passage": "Coming off their bye week, the Bears traveled to Lambeau Field to play the Green Bay Packers in the 189th meeting between the two rivals. The Bears had struggled regarding scoring against Green Bay in the last nine games between the two prior to 2013, and including the 2010 NFC title game, had scored 127 points, an average of 14.11 points. The two teams entered with among the top three scoring offenses, with Chicago and Green Bay ranked second and third, respectively, with 30.4 and 30.3 points per game, both of which rank behind the Denver Broncos. Among the weapons of the Packers offense that the Bears must attempt to hinder was the running game, as Green Bay's rookie running back Eddie Lacy has recorded over 100 yards per game in the previous six during the season, along with quarterback Aaron Rodgers. One of Rodgers' skills is passing balls longer than 20 yards, and was 16 of 32 on these attempts, which was tied with Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks for the highest percentage in the league; the Bears allowed 57 percent of opponents to throw for the aforementioned distance, the second-worst score in the NFL. However, both teams ranked in the bottom five in the NFL in pass rush, with the Bears being in last with only nine sacks. For Chicago, Matt Fort&#233; had gained 533 yards along with averaging 4.6 yards per run, while Josh McCown filled in for Jay Cutler. Since 2009, Bears quarterbacks besides Cutler had thrown a combined eight touchdowns and 21 interceptions against the Packers; in McCown's last start in 2011 against the Packers, he threw for 242 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions in a 35-21 losing effort. On the Packers' first drive, Rodgers failed to recognize the Bears' zone defense, having expected a man-to-man defense, and Shea McClellin escaped Don Barclay's block and, along with Isaiah Frey, pulled Rodgers down, who landed on his shoulder and injured his left collarbone, and was replaced by Seneca Wallace for the remainder of the game. Afterwards, Mason Crosby kicked the 30-yard field goal to give the Packers the lead. On Chicago's first drive, McCown escaped pressure from Mike Neal and threw towards Brandon Marshall for the 7-3 lead. Once the Packers got the ball back, Wallace's pass for Jordy Nelson was tipped and intercepted by Julius Peppers, and was returned 14 yards to Green Bay's 45-yard line, but after the Bears failed to convert on third down, Adam Podlesh's punt was blocked by Jamari Lattimore. Eventually, James Starks ran 32 yards for the touchdown. However, the Bears traveled 60 yards on two plays, and Fort&#233; scored on the 1-yard run. The Bears ended the first half with Robbie Gould's 24-yard field goal to expand the lead to 17-10. In the third quarter, the Packers forced the Bears to punt, and Lacy ran 56 yards to the Bears' 1, and scored on the ensuing play. On the eventual kickoff, the Packers successfully attempted a surprise onside kick, which was recovered by Lattimore. Crosby kicked a 23-yarder on the drive. On the Bears' next drive, McCown threw a six-yard pass to Alshon Jeffery, whose size kept the ball from being knocked away by Davon House. After both teams exchanged punts in the fourth quarter, on the Bears' next drive, began attempting to run out the clock. On 4th and 1 at the Bears' 32 with 7:50 remaining, Fort&#233; ran three yards for the conversion and continuing the drive, which ended with Gould's 27-yard field goal. The drive lasted 18 plays and took up 8:58, leaving only 50 seconds remaining in the game. Despite a 15-yard pass by Wallace to Nelson, sacks by Corey Wootton and McClellin ended the game with a 27-20 victory for the Bears. McCown ended the night completing 22 of 41 passes for 272 yards and two touchdowns, while Wallace completed 11 of 19 for 114 yards and an interception. The win marked the first time the Packers lost at home to an NFC North opponent since 2009, and the first win for the Bears at Lambeau Field since 2007.",

In the second quarter Seattle took the early lead when kicker Olindo Mare made a 23-yard field goal. Then QB Matt Hasselbeck completed a 9-yard TD pass to TE John Carlson. This was followed in the third quarter by RB Leon Washington returning a kickoff 101 yards to the endzone for a touchdown. The lead was broken down with QB Philip Rivers getting a 3-yard TD pass to WR Malcolm Floyd, followed by Hasselbeck getting sacked by ILB Brandon Siler in the endzone for a safety. Then kicker Nate Kaeding made a 29-yard field goal. The Seahawks increased their lead when Mare made a 23-yard field goal, but the Chargers replied and tied the game when Rivers found TE Antonio Gates on a 12-yard TD pass. (With a successful 2-point conversion as Rivers found WR Legedu Naanee). Before the clock struck zero Seattle took the winning score as RB Leon Washington returned his second kickoff of the game into the endzone running 99 yards for a touchdown. Rivers and the Chargers attempted to make a comeback with less than a minute left, but was picked off by rookie Earl Thomas to seal the win for Seattle.",

        "passage": "In week 6, the Lions hosted the NFC West Division-leading San Francisco 49ers. The Lions struck first, when Jason Hanson kicked a 25-yard field goal that came after a San Francisco turnover. Detroit added to their lead when Brandon Pettigrew caught a 16-yard TD pass. In the second quarter, the 49ers finally got on the board with a 1-yard TD run by Frank Gore. San Francisco received a safety when Aldon Smith sacked Matthew Stafford in the end zone. The final points of the first half came just before intermission when David Akers of the 49ers kicked a 55-yard field goal, putting the Lions down at halftime for the fourth consecutive week. After the break, Detroit scored on a 24-yard field goal. San Francisco responded with a field goal of their own, this one from 31 yards out. In the fourth quarter, the Lions' Nate Burleson caught a 5-yard TD pass; the Lions went for a 2-point conversion but Calvin Johnson failed to catch Matthew Stafford's pass. In the final 2 minutes, the 49ers rallied from behind, first with a 6-yard TD catch by Delanie Walker, then a 37-yard field goal by David Akers, putting them up 25-19. With 1:02 left in the game, the Lions attempted another comeback, but San Francisco's defense held them off, handing Detroit its first loss of the season as the team fell to 5-1 and 2nd place in the NFC North. After the game, coaches Jim Schwartz and Jim Harbaugh got into an argument after Schwartz claimed Harbaugh pushed him out of the way when the two coaches were shaking hands.",

The Chiefs struck first as RB Larry Johnson got a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, things got worse for the Rams as QB Damon Huard completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez, while kicker Lawrence Tynes nailed a 42-yard field goal.  St. Louis got on the board with RB Steven Jackson getting a 2-yard TD run, yet Huard and Gonzalez hooked up with each other again on a 25-yard TD strike.  Rams kicker Jeff Wilkins made a 41-yard field goal to end the half.  In the third quarter, QB Marc Bulger completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Curtis for the only score of the period, yet the only score of the fourth quarter came from Huard completing an 11-yard TD pass to TE Kris Wilson. With the loss, the Rams fell to 4-4.",

In the first quarter, Brady hooked up with Graham on a two-yard touchdown pass for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Dillon got a one-yard touchdown run, while Brady hooked up with Caldwell on a 54-yard touchdown pass.  Late in the quarter Packers quarterback Brett Favre was sacked by Tedy Bruschi and was knocked out of the game with injury to his right (throwing) wrist.  In the third quarter, Brady threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to Watson for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, New England put the game away with Brady throwing his fourth touchdown pass of the day to Maroney, a 19-yard strike.  With the win, the Patriots improved to 7-3.",

        "passage": "In the United States, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas. The administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war. In 1917 10 million men were registered. This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3 million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted , compared to 2,442,586 white . Forms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for \"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\". The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the Selective Draft Law Cases on January 7, 1918.",

        "passage": "The Browns dropped their 13th consecutive season-opening game with a 21-18 loss to the Steelers. The scoring began early in the first quarter when Pittsburgh's Tyler Matakevich blocked a Britton Colquitt punt, knocking the ball into the end zone where it was recovered by Anthony Chickillo for a touchdown. The Browns were able to tie the score by the end of the first quarter, however, as rookie quarterback DeShone Kizer orchestrated a 12-play drive that ended when he scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. The game stayed at 7-7 through most of the second quarter, until the Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger connected with tight end Jesse James on a 4-yard touchdown with 45 seconds left in the first half. The 7-play, 91-yard scoring drive was highlighted by a 50-yard reception by Antonio Brown on a tipped ball. After a Zane Gonzalez field goal brought the Browns within 14-10 early in the third quarter, the Steelers drove down the field again. Roethlisberger threw a second touchdown pass to James to put them up by 11, 21-10. The drive was boosted by a 41-yard pass interference penalty on Browns cornerback Jamar Taylor on a deep pass intended for Brown. The score remained 21-10 until under four minutes remained in the game, when Kizer was able to throw his first career touchdown pass to Corey Coleman. A two-point conversion run by Isaiah Crowell brought the Browns to within a field goal, 21-18. The Browns did not get a chance to score again, however, as the Steelers were able to run out the clock after a long pass from Roethlisberger to Brown. Browns head coach Hue Jackson challenged the ruling; however, the catch call on the field was upheld. The 13th-straight season-opening loss extended an NFL record for the Browns, who also fell to 1-18 in season openers since returning to the league in 1999.  The team also lost their 12th straight game against a divisional opponent.  The team started 0-1.",

        "passage": "Surprised by such easy gains in the East, the Republic quickly decided to exploit Portugal's weakness in the Americas. In 1621 the Geoctroyeerde Westindische Compagnie  was created to take control of the sugar trade and colonise America . The Company benefited from a large investment in capital, drawing on the enthusiasm of the best financiers and capitalists of the Republic, such as Isaac de Pinto, by origin a Portuguese Jew. The Dutch West India Company would not, however, be as successful as its eastern counterpart. The Dutch invasion began in 1624 with the conquest of the then capital of the State of Brazil, the city of S\u00e3o Salvador da Bahia, but the Dutch conquest was short lived. In 1625, a joint Spanish-Portuguese fleet of 52 ships and 12,000 men rapidly recaptured Salvador. In 1630 the Dutch returned, and captured Olinda and then Recife, renamed Mauritsstadt, thus establishing the colony of New Holland. The Portuguese commander Matias de Albuquerque retreated his forces inland, to establish a camp dubbed Arraial do Bom Jesus. Until 1635, the Dutch were unable to harvest sugar due to Portuguese guerrilla attacks, and were virtually confined to the walled perimeter of the cities. Eventually, the Dutch evicted the Portuguese with the assistance of a local landlord named Domingos Fernandes Calabar, but on his retreat to Bahia, Matias de Albuquerque captured Calabar at Porto Calvo, and had him hang for treason. The Portuguese fought back two Dutch attacks on Bahia in 1638. Nonenetheless, by 1641 the Dutch captured S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, leaving them in control of northwestern Brazil between Maranh\u00e3o and Sergipe in the south",

I-73 will begin where South Carolina Highway 22 (SC 22) starts at U.S. Route 17 in South Carolina near Briarcliffe Acres, South Carolina. It will then proceed northwest crossing the proposed routing of I-74 (currently South Carolina Highway 31, the Carolina Bays Parkway). After passing Conway, South Carolina, I-73 will leave SC 22 at a new interchange to be constructed  west of U.S. Route 701, and will then use a new highway to be built between SC 22 and South Carolina Highway 917 north of Cool Spring, South Carolina. I-73 will then use an upgraded SC 917 to cross the Little Pee Dee River. It will then proceed on a new freeway alignment between SC 917 and Interstate 95 in South Carolina that would have an interchange with U.S. Route 76 in South Carolina west of Mullins and then would proceed northwest to an exit with U.S. Route 501 near Latta, passing that city to the south before intersecting I-95 near South Carolina Highway 38. After crossing I-95, I-73 will use the chosen middle route, one of six potential alternative corridors that were studied all of which roughly paralleling SC 38 to proceed further north to the North Carolina state line. These alternative corridors were formally announced to the public on September 7, 2006, at a meeting in Bennettsville, South Carolina. The number of possible routes was reduced to three, and a final decision on the preferred northern route was announced on July 19, 2007. The central route caused the least disruption to homes, farms and wetlands. The North Carolina Department of Transportation and South Carolina Department of Transportation Carolina departments of transportation previously agreed to an I-73 corridor crossing the state line along SC  and NC 38 near Hamlet, North Carolina, on February 11, 2005. Previously I-73 had been planned to cross the state line further west, near U.S. Route 1 in North Carolina south of Rockingham, North Carolina.",

        "passage": "San Francisco kept Detroit in the game with missed opportunities, then made just enough plays for a rare two-game winning streak and its first road win. RB Frank Gore set a franchise record with 148 yards rushing in the first half and scored on a 61-yard run before leaving with a concussion. San Francisco led 13-3 at halftime after scoring on three of its first four drives, wishing it had a bigger lead after out gaining Detroit 247-102 yards and recovering a fumble without giving up a turnover. The 49ers had chances to go ahead big in the third quarter because Detroit had two turnovers on its first three plays, but they came away with only a field goal and a 13-point lead. Gore then caught a 7-yard pass, wobbled off the field and didn't return. QB Alex Smith's fumble midway through the third quarter set up a score that helped the Lions get back in the game. The 49ers drove down the field to set up K Joe Nedney's fourth field goal, a key score because it made Detroit go for a TD instead of kicking a tying field goal late in the game. S Keith Lewis intercepted QB Jon Kitna's pass at the 49ers' 2 with 2&#189; minutes left and San Francisco now 4-5 picked up the one first down it needed to seal the game, winning consecutive games for the second time since 2003. RB Frank Gore finished with career-high 159 yards rushing and San Francisco's QB Alex Smith was 14 of 20 for 136 yards with a fumble. WR Arnaz Battle caught six passes for 55 yards, and converted a third-and-4 on the final drive to allow the 49ers to run out the clock. The 49ers' defense again came up huge, allowing only 273 total offensive yards and forcing 4 turnovers. LB Brandon Moore was yet again the story, leading the team with 9 tackles, 2 sacks and forcing 2 turnovers. With the win, the 49ers advanced to 4-5.",

The worst of it all was how unproven rookie Eric Rowe was tasked with covering wide receiver Calvin Johnson for the majority of the games, leading to Johnson catching 3 touchdowns. Philadelphia's offense was no help, either and frustrations, especially from the team's sideline boiled over. Stafford's five passing touchdowns, including three of them to Johnson was too much for the Eagles to overcome and for the second consecutive time this season, the Eagles gave up 45 points in a game. With the loss, the Eagles drop to 4-7 on the season and 6-1 when playing on Thanksgiving. However, hope was revived for the team when the Giants, who could have moved to a commanding 3 game lead in the NFC East, fell to the Washington Redskins, meaning the Eagles were only down 1 game from the Giants and Redskins.",

        "passage": "The Raiders traveled to Baltimore looking to win their third straight road game to open the season for the first time since 2000. The Ravens, undefeated on the season, looked to continue their good start. The Raiders jumped out early, taking a lead on a six-yard touchdown pass to Seth Roberts from Derek Carr. A Baltimore field goal tightened the lead before Carr hit Michael Crabtree for his first of three touchdown scores on the day, and the Raiders took a 14-6 lead to the half as the Raiders defense held the Ravens in check. Baltimore answered in the third quarter, pulling within two on a Joe Flacco one-yard touchdown run. Crabtree again answered for the Raiders on a 13-yard pass from Carr. However, the Raiders defense allowed a 52-yard pass and catch from Flacco to Steve Smith Sr. and the Ravens pulled within two after failing to convert on the two-point conversion. The Raiders lead tightened to 21-19. The Ravens struck again following a fumble by Raiders rookie running back DeAndre Washington and Terrance West scored three-yard touchdown run to take the Ravens first lead of the game 27-21. The Raiders answered, driving down the field before Carr hit Crabtree from 23 yards out. The Raiders took the lead 28-27. As time was running out, the Ravens looked for the game-winning field goal, but the Raiders defense held and the Raiders moved to 3-1 for the first time since 2000. The three-touchdown game marked Crabtree's first career three-touchdown game. Carr finished with four touchdowns on 199 yards passing. The Raiders defense, much maligned on the season, gave up 412 yards, but stopped the Ravens when needed.",

In the first quarter, Chicago struck first with QB Rex Grossman completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Desmond Clark for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Giants got on the board with RB Derrick Ward. Afterwards, the Bears ended the half with kicker Robbie Gould getting a 35-yard and a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Chicago increased its lead with Gould nailing a 41-yard field goal for the only score of the period. However, in the fourth quarter, New York took the lead with QB Eli Manning completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Amani Toomer, along with RB Reuben Droughns.

In the first quarter, Oakland struck first as kicker Sebastian Janikowski got a 25-yard field goal. The Chiefs would respond with kicker Connor Barth getting a 38-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Kansas City took the lead as CB Maurice Leggett returned a fumble (who was from a trick play on a field goal attempt) 67 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, Oakland responded with RB Justin Fargas getting a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Chiefs replied with RB Larry Johnson getting a 2-yard TD run, along with Barth making a 27-yard field goal. The Raiders tried to come back as Janikowski nailed a 51-yard field goal, but Kansas City's defense was too much to overcome.",

        "passage": "In week 5, the Bears recorded the highest margin of victory of the season, defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars 41-3. In the first quarter, the Bears scored first on a Robbie Gould 32-yard field goal, though Jacksonville would respond in the next quarter on Josh Scobee's 31-yard kick. In the second half, the Bears broke the deadlock by kicking another field goal and cornerback Charles Tillman returning a Blaine Gabbert interception 36 yards for a touchdown, breaking former Bears safety Mike Brown's franchise record for the most pick-sixes in a career. Tillman also tied Donnell Woolford for the most interceptions by a cornerback in team history. In the fourth quarter, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's 10-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. Chicago would then extend their lead on Cutler's 24-yard pass to Brandon Marshall to increase the lead to 27-3. Bears linebacker Lance Briggs would then intercept Gabbert and score on a 36-yard return. Briggs and Tillman would become the first pair in league history to return interceptions for touchdowns in consecutive games, and the Bears became the first team in NFL history to return five interceptions for touchdowns in the first five games of a season. The Bears would close out the game with backup running back Armando Allen scoring on a 46-yard touchdown run. The victory improved the team's record to 4-1. The victory is the most lopsided win for the Bears since their 1985 44-0 victory over the Cowboys, and the 38 points scored in the second half are the most since the team scoring 49 second half points in the 1941 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.",

In 1642 some basic fortifications were built, in the form of street barricades and small earthworks. In 1643 a major construction effort was made, to provide a comprehensive ring of fortifications around the city. Much of the work was done by volunteer labour, organized by the trained bands and the livery companies. Up to 20,000 people are thought to be involved, and the works were completed in under two months. The fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647, and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.",

        "passage": "Kabuls population is estimated to have been about 10,000 in 1700, 65,000 by 1878, and 120,000 by 1940. More recently, the population was around 500,000 in 1979, whilst another source claims 337,715 as of 1976. This figure rose to about 1.5 million by 1988, before dramatically dropping in the 1990s. Kabul became one of the fastest growing cities in the world, with its population growing fourfold from 2001 to 2014. This was partly due to the return of refugees after the fall of the Taliban regime, and partly due to Afghans moving from other provinces mainly due to war between Taliban insurgents and Afghan government forces in their native areas as well as looking for labor. This resulting rapid urbanization mean that many residents today live in informal settlements. Shanty mud-brick homes on the mountainsides and steep hills have been built by them and these are usually poverty-stricken, not connected to the water and electricity grid. Although the settlements are illegal, they have been tolerated by authorities. In 2017 Kabul Municipality started a project to paint the homes in these settlements in bright colors in an effort to \"cheer up\" residents.",

        "passage": "In their first home game in nearly a month, the Patriots faced the Broncos, winners of 16 of the last 19 games between the two teams, on Monday Night Football; earlier that day, the Patriots placed Maroney on injured reserve with a shoulder injury after he had missed two of the team's last three games, and activated offensive lineman Stephen Neal from the physically unable to perform list. After winning the coin toss, the Patriots deferred their pick to the start of the second half; the Broncos elected to receive. On the opening series, Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler injured his finger on the first play, but led the Broncos into Patriots territory, where running back Andre Hall, who replaced injured starter Michael Pittman two plays prior, fumbled at the Patriots' 30-yard line; Patriots defensive lineman Le Kevin Smith's recovery gave the Patriots the ball at their own 32-yard line to begin their first drive. A 29-yard reception by Watson brought the Patriots into the Broncos' red zone, where the drive ended and a 31-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. On the fourth play of the Broncos' ensuing drive, Hall fumbled again; this time, a scramble for the ball pushed it 25 yards in the Patriots' favor to the Broncos' 37-yard line, where Mayo recovered it. A Broncos unnecessary roughness penalty on the play gave the ball to the Patriots at the Broncos' 22-yard line, but after failing to make a first down, a 40-yard Gostkowski field goal extended the Patriots' lead to 6-0. An exchange of three punts brought the game into the second quarter, where Morris ran for 34 yards on the second play of a Patriots drive to put them in the Broncos' red zone yet again. Four plays later, on 4th-and-1 from the Broncos' 4-yard line, Morris ran for a 4-yard touchdown that gave the Patriots a 13-0 lead. The Broncos' next drive ended with Meriweather intercepting a deep throw by Cutler, setting up the Patriots' next series at their own 16-yard line. After a sack of Cassel put the Patriots even deeper into their own territory, a facemask penalty on Cassel on third down by Broncos linebacker Jamie Winborn gave the Patriots a new set of downs. Five plays later, on another 4th-and-1, Morris ran for 29 yards to give the Patriots a first down from the Broncos' 13-yard line; he ran for a total of 138 yards on 16 carries. On the next play, Moss caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Cassel to extend the Patriots' lead to 20-0. The Broncos' next drive began with backup Patrick Ramsey replacing Cutler at quarterback. On the fourth play, defensive lineman Mike Wright sacked Ramsey and forced a fumble, which undrafted free agent linebacker Gary Guyton caught to give the Patriots the ball at midfield. Cassel suffered his fifth sack on the next play, the final of the first half. The Patriots chose to receive the ball to open the second half. Another undrafted rookie, running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis, elevated from the Patriots' practice squad before the Chargers game, replaced Morris, who left the game with a knee injury. A Patriots punt was followed by a Broncos three-and-out; Welker returned the punt 44 yards to give the Patriots the ball at the Broncos' 28-yard line. After two Green-Ellis carries gained one yard, Cassel used a screen play to throw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Moss to extend the Patriots' lead to 27-0. Three completed passes and an unnecessary roughness penalty on Patriots defensive lineman Vince Wilfork moved the Broncos' next drive into Patriots' territory before the Broncos turned the ball over for the fifth and final time, with safety James Sanders intercepting a Cutler pass; a second unnecessary roughness call, originally on Wilfork but later changed to be on Sanders, gave the Patriots the ball at their own 20-yard line to begin the ensuing drive. Three plays after a 27-yard Welker catch put the Patriots in Broncos territory, Broncos safety Calvin Lowry appeared to have intercepted an errant Cassel throw at the Broncos' 1-yard line, but, when the Patriots challenged, the pass was deemed incomplete, as the ball touched the ground before Lowry had possession. Two plays later, Welker caught his first touchdown pass of the season, this one from 6 yards out, to give the Patriots a 34-0 lead. Four plays later, former Patriots tight end Daniel Graham caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from Cutler to cut the Patriots' lead to 34-7. The Patriots' next drive got as far as the Broncos' 33-yard line but eventually ended in a punt. The Broncos, facing 3rd-and-21 on their next drive, had a 21-yard completion by Cutler pushed back by a Broncos holding penalty; Richard Seymour sacked Cutler on the next play, forcing the Broncos to punt on 4th-and-23 with 6:35 left in the game. On the ensuing Patriots drive, two 10-yard runs by Green-Ellis and 16- and 15-yard runs by Faulk put the Patriots in the red zone, where Green-Ellis earned his first NFL touchdown, running in untouched from the 1-yard line, to score the final points of the game. Another Broncos punt gave the Patriots the ball to end the game with a 41-7 victory that took the Patriots' record to 4-2. The Patriots accumulated 257 rushing yards, their largest total since the 1985 season. Cassel, who completed 18 of 24 passes for 185 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions, finished with a passer rating of 136.3, one of the ten highest single-game ratings in Patriots history, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. On the final play of the third quarter, as the Broncos were driving into Patriots territory, Harrison was injured while attempting to tackle Cutler. Harrison, whose 2005 and 2006 seasons were cut short by knee injuries that caused ligament damage, suffered a torn quadriceps muscle in his right leg. Harrison was carted off the field and placed on injured reserve two days later. Safety Antwain Spann was then activated from the practice squad. The Broncos also lost players to injury: Ramsey and linebacker Boss Bailey were also placed on injured reserve, while cornerback Champ Bailey was sidelined for several weeks by a torn groin muscle.",

        "passage": "All this led to the October Revolution in Petrograd, which quickly spread all over the empire. The Kiev Uprising in November 1917 led to the defeat of Russian imperial forces in the capital. Soon after, the Central Rada took power in Kiev, while in late December 1917 the Bolsheviks set up a rival Ukrainian republic in the eastern city of Kharkov  - initially also called the \"Ukrainian People's Republic\". Hostilities against the Central Rada government in Kiev began immediately. Under these circumstances, the Rada declared Ukrainian independence on January 22, 1918 and broke ties with Russia. The Rada had a limited armed force at its disposal  and was hard-pressed by the Kharkov government which received men and resources from the Russian SFSR. As a result, the Bolsheviks quickly overran Poltava, Aleksandrovsk , and Yekaterinoslav  by January 1918. Across Ukraine, local Bolsheviks also formed the Odessa and Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republics; and in the south Nestor Makhno formed the Free Territory - an anarchist region - then allied his forces with the Bolsheviks. Aided by the earlier Kiev Arsenal Uprising, the Red Guards entered the capital on February 9, 1918. This forced the Central Rada to evacuate to Zhytomyr. In the meantime, the Romanians took over Bessarabia. Most remaining Russian Imperial Army units either allied with the Bolsheviks or joined the Ukrainian People's Army. A notable exception was Colonel Mikhail Drozdovsky, who marched his White Volunteer Army unit across the whole of Novorossiya to the River Don, defeating Makhno's forces in the process.",

        "passage": "News of the two battles reached England in August. After several months of negotiations, the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French. They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition. Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock's departure for North America. In response, King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755. The British sent out their fleet in February 1755, intending to blockade French ports, but the French fleet had already sailed. Admiral Edward Hawke detached a fast squadron to North America in an attempt to intercept them. In a second British action, Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide on June 8, 1755, capturing her and two troop ships. The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755, seizing ships and capturing seamen. These actions contributed to the eventual formal declarations of war in spring 1756.",

        "passage": "Uro\u0161 III's decision not to attack the Byzantines after the victory at the Battle of Velbazhd against Bulgaria resulted in the alienation of many nobles, who sought to expand to the south. By January or February 1331, Du\u0161an was quarreling with his father, perhaps pressured by the nobility. According to contemporary pro-Du\u0161an sources, evil advisors turned Uro\u0161 III against his son; he decided to seize and exclude Du\u0161an of his inheritance. Uro\u0161 III sent an army into Zeta against his son, the army ravaged Skadar, but Du\u0161an had crossed the Bojana. A brief period of anarchy in parts of Serbia took place before the father and son concluded peace in April 1331. Three months later, Uro\u0161 III ordered Du\u0161an to meet him. Du\u0161an feared for his life and his advisors persuaded him to resist, so Du\u0161an marched from Skadar to Nerodimlje, where he besieged his father. Uro\u0161 III fled, and Du\u0161an captured the treasury and family. He then pursued his father, catching up with him at Petri\u0107. On 21 August 1331, Uro\u0161 III surrendered, and on the advice or insistence of Du\u0161an's advisors, he was imprisoned. Du\u0161an was crowned King of All Serbian and Maritime lands in the first week of September. The civil war had prevented Serbia from aiding Ivan Stephen and Anna Neda in Bulgaria, who were deposed in March 1331, taking refuge in the mountains. Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria feared for the danger of Serbia as the situation there had settled, and immediately sought peace with Du\u0161an. As Du\u0161an wanted to move against richer Byzantium, the two made peace and an alliance in December 1331, accepting Ivan Alexander as ruler. It was sealed with the marriage of Du\u0161an and Helena, the sister of Ivan Alexander.",

        "passage": "In South America , the Portuguese conquered from Spain most of the Rio Negro valley, and repelled a Spanish attack on Mato Grosso . Between September 1762 and April 1763, Spanish forces led by don Pedro Antonio de Cevallos, Governor of Buenos Aires  undertook a campaign against the Portuguese in Uruguay and South Brazil. The Spaniards conquered the Portuguese territories of Colonia do Sacramento and Rio Grande de S\u00e3o Pedro and forced the Portuguese to surrender and retreat. Under the Treaty of Paris , Spain had to return to Portugal the colony of Sacramento, while the vast and rich territory of the so-called \"Continent of S. Peter\"  would be retaken from the Spanish army during the undeclared Hispano-Portuguese war of 1763-1777. As consequence of the war the Valdivian Fort System, a Spanish defensive complex in southern Chile, was updated and reinforced from 1764 onwards. Other vulnerable localities of colonial Chile such as Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago, Concepci\u00f3n, Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands and Valpara\u00edso were also made ready for an eventual English attack.",

Szil\u00e1gyi could rely on a force of only 5,000-7,000 men in the castle. Mehmed set up his siege on the neck of the headland and started heavily bombarding the city's walls on June 29. He arrayed his men in three sections: The Rumelian corps had the majority of his 300 cannons, while his fleet of 200 river war vessels had the rest of them. The Rumelians were arrayed on the right wing and the Anatolian corps were arrayed on the left. In the middle were the personal guards of the Sultan, the Janissaries, and his command post. The Anatolian corps and the Janissaries were both heavy infantry troops. Mehmed posted his river vessels mainly to the northwest of the city to patrol the marshes and ensure that the fortress was not reinforced. They also kept an eye on the Sava river to the southwest to avoid the infantry from being outflanked by Hunyadi's army. The zone from the Danube eastwards was guarded by the Sipahi, the Sultan's feudal heavy cavalry corps, to avoid being outflanked on the right.",

        "passage": "Looking to stay in the playoff hunt, the Raiders welcomed the Dallas Cowboys to Oakland for Sunday Night Football. The Raiders struggled from the outset, allowing the Cowboys to drive inside Raider territory before Sean Smith intercepted a Dak Prescott pass to end the drive. Following a punt by the Raiders, the Cowboys moved right down the field, but were stopped at the Oakland 27 yard line. Settling for a 45-yard field goal, the Cowboys took the lead. The Raiders failed to manage a first down again on their second possession, the Cowboys took over and moved down field again. This time, the Raider defense could not stop the Cowboys and Rod Smith scored on a one-yard run to increase the Cowboy lead to 10-0. The Raider offense did manage two first downs on their next possession, but again were forced to punt. After forcing a Cowboy punt, the Raiders took over with just over three minutes left in the half. The offense came alive as the Raiders moved down to the Cowboy 11 yard line. Derek Carr then hit Jared Cook for an 11 yard touchdown, but Cook was called for pass interference on the play and the touchdown was taken off the board. The Raiders drive stalled and, with three seconds remaining, Giorgio Tavecchio missed a 39-yard field goal as the half expired leaving the score at 10-0. On the opening kickoff of the second half, Cordarrelle Patterson returned the kick 100 yards for a touchdown. However, the return was nullified on a Raider holding call. However, the Raider offense would make up for the mistake as they took the ball 90 yards and Carr found Michael Crabtree on a two-yard pass to narrow the lead to 10-7. On the ensuing Cowboy possession, Sean Smith intercepted Dak Prescott for the second time in the game and returned it 22 yards for a touchdown and Raider lead. Upon review of the play, it was determined that Smith was down by contact at the 22. The Raider offense failed to capitalize on the turnover, only managing one yard and settling for a Tavecchio 39-yard field goal to tie the game at 10. The Raider defense continued its strong play to start the second half by stopping the Cowboys on three plays on the next possession. However, punter Chris Jones took the snap and rushed around the right side of the line for a 24-yard gain and a first down. Nine plays later, Prescott scrambled in from five yards out to retake the lead 17-10. As the fourth quarter began, the Raiders answered as Carr again hit Crabtree from two yards out to cap a 53-yard drive to tie the game at 17. Following punts by both teams, the Cowboys moved to the Raider five-yard line as the two minute warning sounded. However, the Raider defense stiffened and the Cowboys could not get the ball in the end zone. Dan Bailey hit a 19-yard field goal with 1:47 remaining to give the Cowboys a 20-17 lead. Needing a field goal to tie, the Raiders drive stalled at their own 30 yard line with just over one minute remaining. On fourth down, Carr rolled out of the pocket and heaved the ball downfield to Crabtree who could not make the catch. But, the Cowboys were called for pass interference on the play and the Raiders took over on the Dallas 15, well within field goal range. Two plays later, Carr scrambled to the goal line and would have had a first down, but instead attempted to dive to the pylon to score the winning touchdown. Carr, however, lost control of the ball attempting to reach it into the end zone and fumbled it out of the end zone giving the ball to the Cowboys on a touchback. The Cowboys were able to a knee to end the game and secure the 20-17 win. The loss moved the Raiders to 6-8 on the season and eliminated them from the AFC West race. Carr threw for only 171 yards in the game as the offense, as usual, struggled through most of the game. The Raiders committed 14 penalties for 105 yards in the game as their disastrous season all but came to an end.",

Chicago would trail early in the first quarter as Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner hooked up with wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald on an 11-yard touchdown pass.  The Bears would answer as quarterback Jay Cutler competed a 33-yard touchdown pass to tight end Greg Olsen, but Arizona came right back as Warner hooked up with tight end Ben Patrick on a 6-yard touchdown pass.  Chicago would find themselves in a huge deficit in the second quarter as Warner completed a 17-yard touchdown pass to Fitzpatrick and a 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end Anthony Becht, followed by kicker Neil Rackers nailing a 43-yard field goal. The Cardinals would add onto their lead as Rackers booted a 30-yard field goal in the third quarter.  The Bears tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Cutler connected with Olsen on a 3-yard and a 20-yard touchdown pass, but Arizona pulled away with Warner completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Steve Breaston.",

        "passage": "Tampa bay faced in-state rival Jacksonville Jaguars for the fourth time in the regular season. Injured Jacksonville starting quarterback David Garrard was replaced by Quinn Gray, while Jeff Garcia hoped to extend on a 217-consecutive passing streak without an interception. In the first half, Jacksonville's running attack of Fred Taylor, LaBrandon Toefield and Maurice Jones-Drew rushed 15 times in their first 16 plays from scrimmage, and eventually set up a 10-3 lead. In the second quarter, Garcia threw his first interception of the season, which was returned for a Jacksonville score. Tampa Bay quickly responded, however, driving 81 yards in three plays, capped off with Garcia and Joey Galloway connecting for a 58-yard touchdown. A momentum shift appeared to occur near the end of the second quarter, as Tampa Bay forced Jacksonville into a 3-and-out. Inside the two-minute warning, Garcia drove the Buccaneers to the 4-yard line. Garcia scrambled on 3rd & 10, colliding with Reggie Nelson, losing his helmet, but fell one yard short of the first down. Tampa Bay settled for a Matt Bryant field goal, and a 13-17 halftime deficit. Tampa Bay's defense dominated the third quarter, forcing Jacksonville a turnover on downs, a fumble in the end zone (recovered by Gray on 1-yard line), and a blocked punt. The good field position led to Michael Bennett's first touchdown as a Buccaneer. The fourth quarter saw Jacksonville re-take the lead with an 8-yard touchdown pass. Despite two late drives starting with decent field position, Tampa Bay's effort died when Garcia's pass was deflected and intercepted with 19 seconds remaining, his third pick of the game. The loss dropped Tampa Bay to 4-4, second place in the NFC South.",

        "passage": "The French conquest of Morocco took place in 1911 in the aftermath of the Agadir Crisis, when Moroccan forces besieged the French-occupied city of Fez. On 30 March 1912, Sultan Abdelhafid signed the Treaty of Fez, formally ceding Moroccan sovereignty to France, transforming Morocco into a protectorate of France. However, many regions remained in revolt until 1934, when Morocco was declared to be pacified, but in several regions French authority was maintained by cooperation with local chiefs and not military strength. On 17 April 1912, Moroccan infantrymen mutinied in the French garrison in Fez. The Moroccans were unable to take the city and were defeated by a French relief force. In late May 1912, Moroccan forces unsuccessfully attacked the enhanced French garrison at Fez. The last aftermath of the conquest of Morocco occurred in 1933-34, the pacification of Morocco took over 22 years.",

Throughout the course of the game, the Bears defense sacked Rams quarterback Sam Bradford six times, marking the first time the Bears defense has recorded at least five sacks in back-to-back games since the team's 2001 season. The six sacks increased the Bears season sack total to 14, which led the league, and is the most they have recorded in the first three games since 1987. On the offensive side, however, Jay Cutler completed only 17 of 31 passes for 183 yards and an interception (by Cortland Finnegan; Finnegan appeared to fumble on the return, and the ball was recovered by Bears receiver Devin Hester, but the fumble was overturned), and a mere passer rating of 58.9. With running back Matt Forte out for the game, the Bears rushing attack ran for 103 yards and Michael Bush ran for a 3-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein kicked a 56-yard field goal, the longest in Soldier Field history. In the fourth quarter, Bears cornerback Tim Jennings deflected a Bradford pass intended for Danny Amendola to Major Wright, who returned the interception 45 yards for a touchdown.",

        "passage": "NFC East leaders for the second straight week, the 10-4 Eagles remained home for an interconference matchup with the 8-6 Denver Broncos. The Eagles jumped out to an early 10-0 lead in the 1st quarter, recovering from a quick turnover on their first possession. Philadelphia quarterback Donovan McNabb was sacked, losing the ball in the process. The loose ball was picked up by Denver's Darrell Reid. The Philadelphia defense was able to keep the Broncos from turning it into any points, forcing a punt, and scored on their next possession with a 2-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson. Soon after, David Akers' 39 yard field goal pushed the Eagles' lead to 10, closing the first quarter. Denver answered with an 11-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Kyle Orton to wide receiver Jabar Gaffney, capping off a 12 play, 70 yard drive on their very first possession of the second period. Up 10-7, the Eagles immediately responded on the following drive as Donovan McNabb hit his tight end Brent Celek for a 47-yard passing touchdown. The Eagles forced another punt, David Akers added 3 more points on his second field goal of the day, and the Eagles' halftime lead stood at 13. Now down 20-7, the Broncos started the second half strong, forcing another Eagles turnover on the second play of the third quarter. McNabb was intercepted by Champ Bailey, setting up a 33-yard field goal by Matt Prater to reduce the lead to 10. Philadelphia's next possession gave them their largest lead of the game after Donovan McNabb found Jason Avant for his third passing touchdown of the day. Kyle Orton was then intercepted by Asante Samuel, and the Broncos' hopes of a comeback were fading away. However, Denver forced a 3-and-out, scored on another passing touchdown to Jabar Gaffney, and recovered the fumble by Macho Harris on the following kickoff. Orton found Knowshon Moreno for his third passing touchdown of the day, and, within two minutes, the Eagles' 17-point lead was down to 3. In the fourth, Matt Prater succeeded on a 46-yard field goal attempt and the game was tied at 27 with just over 6 minutes to go. After offensive possessions for each team, both ending in punts, the Eagles got the ball back with 1:41 remaining to set up a 28-yard field goal by David Akers, leaving the Broncos with 7 seconds of game time. Time ran out on the ensuing kickoff, and the Eagles held on to win by a score of 30-27. The victory, their sixth consecutive, boosted Philadelphia's record to 11-4, setting up a decisive Week 17 game with the Cowboys for the division title.",

        "passage": "The Redskins began the 2007 NFL season by \"winning ugly\" starting the season off 2\u20130. The Redskins kept winning and losing close games, the only exception to this a 34\u20133 rout of the 2007 Detroit Lions season. The Redskins continued to win ugly and lose ugly to be 5\u20133 at the halfway mark. However, the Redskins would begin to collapse. The Washington Redskins lost their next three games to fall to 5\u20136. On Monday, November 26, 2007, Redskins superstar, Sean Taylor was shot by intruders early in the morning in his Miami home. The next morning, Sean Taylor died from severe blood loss. The heartbreak continued for the Washington Redskins, taking a 9\u20132 halftime lead against the 2007 Buffalo Bills season, and eventually a 16\u20135 lead. However, the Bills cut the lead to 16\u201314, and got into position with just 8 seconds remaining to win the game. In an attempt to ice the kicker, head coach Joe Gibbs called timeout. However, he attempted to re-ice him, and called timeout again, which drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, reducing the field goal from 51 yards to 36, and Bills kicker Rian Lindell nailed it with ease. Following the heartbreaking loss, the Redskins attended Sean Taylors funeral two days later, with a game to play on Thursday night against the 2007 Chicago Bears season. The bad news continued, as quarterback Jason Campbell went down for the season with a knee injury. Following this, unlikely hero and backup quarterback Todd Collins (quarterback) led the Redskins to the victory, keeping their playoff hopes alive. Things continued to turn in the right direction behind Collins, who led the Redskins to a 22\u201310 victory on NBC Sunday Night Football over the 2007 New York Giants season and routs of the 2007 Minnesota Vikings season and rival 2007 Dallas Cowboys season in the final two weeks to propel the Redskins to 9\u20137 and the final playoff spot in the 2007\u201308 NFL playoffs.",

After Nazi Germany had annexed the Free City of Danzig in World War II, the exiled Polish government in releases said that the knights had \"massacre ten thousand souls\", portrayed the contemporary Germans in the tradition of these events and linked these events with National Socialism. In 1969 the post-war Polish city authorities dedicated a monument that commemorates the massacre of the population of Gda\u0144sk in 1308. Its stated aim was to propagate an analogy of the events of 1308 and the German crimes of World War II. On the monument, called Tym co za Polsko\u015b\u0107 Gda\u0144ska , the dates 1308, 1454, 1466 and 1939 are mentioned, relating the events of 1308 to the Thirteen Years' War and World War II.",

Following a scoreless first quarter, a 47-yard field goal by placekicker Jason Myers gave the Jaguars the brief lead. The Broncos then reeled off 17 unanswered points, with a 6-yard touchdown run by running back Devontae Booker and a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus just before halftime. Then, in the third quarter, cornerback Bradley Roby returned an interception off quarterback Blake Bortles 51 yards for a touchdown. The Jaguars narrowed the Broncos' lead to 17-10 early in the fourth quarter, when Bortles ran for a 22-yard touchdown. Following an exchange of punts throughout the majority of the fourth quarter, the Jaguars were attempting a rally just after the two-minute warning, when Broncos' linebacker Shane Ray forced a strip sack and fumble recovery off Bortles in Jaguars' territory. Four plays later, McManus added a 41-yard field goal with only 33 seconds remaining to put the game out of reach.",

The last time the Bears had been 3-5, yet made the playoffs was in 1979, and had also performed the feat in 1977, while the last time that Chicago had made the playoffs after having a record of two games below .500 occurred in 2005, when the team was 1-3, but finished the regular season 11-5. On offense, the Bears were tied for seventh in the league in passes per game with 37.4 and 27th in rushing attempts per game with 23.5. The offense had also regressed in points scored per game; in 2013, the team averaged 27.8 points, while after eight games in 2014, had scored only 22.4, despite having all 11 starters from 2013 returning. In their first three games, the Bears had a +4 turnover margin with eight turnovers forced and four turnovers allowed, but in their last five games, the margin was -7 with four takeaways and 11 giveaways, including -5 in the previous two games with no forced turnovers and five allowed turnovers; this marked the first time that the Bears had failed to force a turnover in consecutive games since 2010. Despite these struggles, the Bears' offense had the league's fifth-best red zone scoring percentage with 88.5.",

        "passage": "Coming off their win over the Falcons, the Patriots stayed at home for a Week 4 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens. The opening kickoff was fumbled by Ravens returner Chris Carr and recovered by McGowan at the Ravens' 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not capitalize on the field position, settling for a 32-yard Gostkowski field goal to give them an early 3-0 lead. The Ravens began their first drive from their own 19-yard line and advanced on a 15-play drive, capping it with a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Derrick Mason. The Patriots responded with a 14-play drive of their own, going 76 yards before Brady scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to re-establish a Patriots lead at 10-7. The Ravens reached midfield on their next drive with a 22-yard reception by tight end Todd Heap, but the drive stalled at the Patriots' 38-yard line, setting up a punt by Sam Koch that gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line. Similarly, the Patriots reached Ravens' territory before having to punt; Hanson's punt landed in the end zone for a touchback. On the second play of the Ravens' ensuing drive, left tackle Jared Gaither injured his head falling into Flacco during a block; while he had motion in his extremities, the game was stopped for 15 minutes as Gaither was loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital for tests. The Ravens' drive finished as a three-and-out. The Patriots then went 63 yards on six plays, extending their lead to 17-7 on a 12-yard touchdown run by Morris. With just under four minutes remaining in the half, the Ravens mounted a drive that reached the Patriots' 17-yard line with 1:17 left; Flacco was intercepted by Bodden to prevent the Ravens from scoring again before halftime. The Patriots first drive of the second half was aided by a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on the Ravens' bench, but the Patriots were unable to capitalize as a Matt Light holding penalty and a Jarret Johnson sack of Brady forced a punt. Starting from their own 16-yard line, the Ravens advanced to their 45-yard line before a Wright sack of Flacco set up another punt. Kevin Faulk fielded the return but fumbled; Bodden recovered the fumble for the Patriots at their own 14-yard line. On the next play, Brady dropped back and was strip-sacked from his blind side by Terrell Suggs; defensive lineman Dwan Edwards recovered the fumble for the Ravens in the end zone for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 17-14. Brady quickly recovered, hitting passes to Taylor for 13 yards, Aiken for 26 yards, and Moss for 20 yards to put the Patriots in the Ravens' red zone. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected for their first touchdown of the season; the 14-yard strike extended the Patriots' lead to 24-14. The Ravens had similar success on his next drive, with Flacco hitting Mark Clayton on a 13-yard catch, Mason on a 20-yard catch, and then running back Ray Rice breaking a 50-yard rush to put the Ravens well into Patriots territory. A few plays later, Flacco kept pace with Brady on a 13-yard touchdown pass to running back Willis McGahee to cut the Patriots' lead to 24-21. The Patriots would control the ball for the next seven minutes, reaching the Ravens' 9-yard line on a second down. After two incomplete passes, the Patriots lined up in a field goal formation but the holder, Hanson, took a quick snap and passed to Baker, who had motioned outside of the formation. Baker was tackled around the first down marker, but was called for an illegal motion on the play. The Ravens challenged the ruling of a catch and the first down spot, as they would have declined the penalty if Baker had been short. The ruling was upheld and the Patriots took a 27-21 lead on a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Ravens mounted a drive with 3:32 left, reaching the Patriots' red zone with under a minute remaining. On third and fourth down, Flacco's passes fell incomplete to Mason and Clayton, ending the Ravens' hopes of a comeback. Brady then kneeled to hand the Ravens their first loss of the season and better the Patriots' record to 3-1.",

        "passage": "The Lithuanian Civil War of 1432-1438 was a conflict over the succession to the throne of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after Vytautas the Great died in 1430 without leaving an heir.  The war was fought on the one side by \u0160vitrigaila, allied with the Teutonic Knights, and on the other by Sigismund K\u0119stutaitis, backed by the Kingdom of Poland. The war threatened to sever the Union of Krewo, the personal union between Poland and Lithuania. \u0160vitrigaila's alliance with the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Paul von Rusdorf, launched the Polish-Teutonic War  but failed to secure victory for \u0160vitrigaila. When Sigismund captured power in Lithuania by staging a coup in 1432, Lithuania split into two opposing camps, and there began three years of devastating hostilities. To prevent the Knights from continuing their support of \u0160vitrigaila, Poland backed a Hussite invasion of Prussia in 1433. The war ended in a decisive defeat for \u0160vitrigaila and his ally, the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Knights, at the Battle of Pabaiskas in September 1435. \u0160vitrigaila eventually surrendered in 1437; Sigismund K\u0119stutaitis ruled Lithuania for only eight years before he was assassinated in 1440.",

        "passage": "After a close win against the Falcons, the Steelers returned home for a game against the Chiefs.  They were facing a WIN AND IN scenario for the playoffs.  They would score first in the first quarter when Shaun Suisham kicked a 23-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  The Chiefs managed to tie it up later on in the quarter when Cairo Santos nailed a 35-yard field goal for a 3-3 game.  The Chiefs took the lead in the 2nd quarter when Santos kicked a 25-yard field goal for a 6-3 game.  The Steelers later on in the quarter retook the lead as Le'Veon Bell ran for a 1-yard TD for a halftime score of 10-6.  After the break, the Steelers got back to work in the 3rd quarter as Ben Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 3-yard TD pass for a 17-6 game.  In the 4th quarter, the Chiefs came within 8 when Santos kicked another field goal from 43 yards out for a 17-9 game.  The Steelers however pulled away as Suisham kicked a 20-yard field goal for a 20-9 game.  Santos would later on kick a 23-yard field goal for the eventual final score of 20-12. With the win, the Steelers improved to 10-5 and endured their first playoff appearance since 2011. Antonio Brown finished the game with 122 catches on the season, the third-highest single-season total in league history while Jamaal Charles was held to his second-lowest rushing total of the season.",

        "passage": "At the time of the fall of Nojpet\u00e9n, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war. Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part. Catholic priests from Yucat\u00e1n founded several mission towns around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in 1702-1703. The first towns to be concentrated into colonial reducciones were Ixtutz, which became the new town of San Jos\u00e9, and neighbouring San Andr\u00e9s, both on the north shore of Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. They were first subjugated by one of Urs\u00faa's officers, Cristobal de Sologaistoa, before being passed into the care of the Dominican friars for the Christian conversion of the inhabitants. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704 and almost retook Nojpet\u00e9n, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed, and most of the mission towns were abandoned; by 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Pet\u00e9n. The reductions failed in large part because the missionaries charged with converting the inhabitants could not speak the Itza language.",

In the second quarter, Dallas took the lead with RB Marion Barber getting a 1-yard TD run.  Miami would close out the first half with Feely getting a 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Cowboys trailed as Dolphins QB Trent Green completed an 18-yard TD pass to WR Marty Booker.  Dallas jumped back into the lead with QB Tony Romo completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Tony Curtis, along with Folk's 28-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Cowboys took control with Folk's 47-yard field goal and Romo's 34-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Miami's Green completed a 21-yard TD pass to WR Derek Hagan, but Dallas responded with Barber's 40-yard TD run.

        "passage": "On June 1, 1922, in Helsinki, Finland and Soviet Russia signed an Agreement between RSFSR and Finland about the measures providing the inviolability of the Soviet-Finnish border. Both parties agreed to reduce the number of border guards and to keep those who do not reside permanently in the border zone from freely crossing the border from either side to the other. Towards the end of the uprising some 30\u00a0000 East Karelian refugees evacuated to Finland. The Karelian Worker's Commune was renamed into the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1923, and its autonomy was further expanded. However the cultural autonomy practically ended in 1933 - 1935 when the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Finnish leaders Edvard Gylling and Kustaa Rovio were purged and teaching of Finnish language was prohibited.  Gylling had promoted the adoption of Finnish rather than Karelian within the KASSR as he and the other \u00e9migr\u00e9 Finns who dominated the leadership of Karelia prior to 1935 did not consider Karelian to be anything more than a rustic dialect of Finnish.  It may also be argued they held the same view of the essential unity of the Karelians and Finns as one Finnic people as their nationalist counterparts, and also wished that they be unified .",

        "passage": "Khuzestan has been a troublesome province of Iran since the ascent of the Pahlavi rule in the 1920s. In the two decades before 1924, although nominally part of Persian territory, the western part of Khuzestan functioned as an autonomous emirate known as \"Arabistan\". The eastern part of Khuzestan was governed by Bakhtiari khans because the eastern part of Khuzestan was mainly inhabited by Bakhtiari people. With rising power of Reza Khan and his increasingly negative attitudes on tribal autonomies in Iran, tensions with shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah had grown from 1922 to 1924. Attempts to withdraw more taxes and reduce Khazal's authority heated it up even more. In response Khaz'al al-Ka'bi initiated a rebellion. The short rebellion by Sheikh Khazal, at its peak in November 1924, was quickly crushed by the newly installed Pahlavi dynasty with minimal casualties. The emirate was dissolved by Reza Shah government in 1925, along with other autonomous regions of Persia, in a bid to centralize the state. At least 115 people died in the insurrection. A low level conflict between the central Iranian government and the Arab separatists of the western part of the province continued since.",

        "passage": "Hoping to add to a nine-game winning streak, the Broncos returned home for an AFC match-up with the Cleveland Browns. On the game's opening drive, quarterback Peyton Manning threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. The Browns got on the scoreboard, with a 27-yard field goal by placekicker Phil Dawson. A 10-yard touchdown pass from Manning to wide receiver Eric Decker was the only scoring play of the second quarter. The Browns narrowed the Broncos' lead early in the third quarter, with a 53-yard field goal by Dawson, but the Broncos would add 17 unanswered points to their lead, with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Decker, followed in the fourth quarter by a 27-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater and a 1-yard touchdown run by fullback Jacob Hester. The Browns finally scored a touchdown midway through the fourth quarter, with quarterback Colt McCoy connecting on a 6-yard pass to wide receiver Greg Little, but the Broncos' lead was too much for the Browns to overcome. Prater added a 41-yard field goal to close out the scoring. The Broncos matched their win total from the two previous seasons combined, and also swept the AFC North division. The Broncos won their 10th consecutive game against the Browns, dating back to the 1991 season, and improved their all-time series record against the Browns to 22-5 (including the playoffs).",

        "passage": "New Caledonia is a major source for nickel and contains roughly 10% of the worlds known nickel supply. The islands contain about 7,100,000 tonnes of nickel. With the annual production of about 107,000 tonnes in 2009, New Caledonia was the Nickel mining in New Caledonia after Russia (266,000), Indonesia (189,000), Canada (181,000) and Australia (167,000). In recent years, the economy has suffered because of depressed international demand for nickel, due to the ongoing financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. Only a negligible amount of the land is suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition to nickel, the substantial financial support from France and tourism are keys to the health of the economy. In the 2000s, large additions were made to nickel mining capacity. The Goro, New Caledonia is expected to be one of the largest nickel producing plants on Earth. When full-scale production begins in 2013 this plant will produce an estimated 20% of the global nickel supply. However, the need to respond to environmental concerns over the countrys globally recognized ecological heritage, may increasingly need to be factored into capitalization of mining operations.",

New York continued to build their lead in the third quarter as Folk nailed a 34-yard field goal. The Vikings answered with quarterback Brett Favre completed a 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Randy Moss, yet the Jets came right back with Folk's 31-yard field goal. After the match was delayed due to adverse weather conditions, Minnesota began to strike back in the fourth quarter as Favre connected with wide receiver Percy Harvin on a 34-yard touchdown pass (with a failed 2-point conversion). Afterwards, New York answer as running back Shonn Greene got a 23-yard touchdown run.

However, the Peasants' War of 1626 was the costliest in terms of human life and damage to livestock and property. The war caused Martin Aichinger to lose his farm and begin roaming the country. He eventually became a religious leader who led a popular revolt against aristocratic rule. His revolutionary ideas frightened the rulers so much that they tried to arrest him, leading to another series of uprisings that ended in the Battle on the Frankenberg  in 1636. All of Aichinger's followers were slaughtered during the battle, including the remaining women and children who had been in hiding.",

        "passage": "The split effectively ended the realistic electoral chances of the Irish Unionist Alliance in southern Ireland. As the partition of Ireland became more likely, Southern Unionists formed numerous political movements in an attempt to find a solution to the \"Irish Question\". Among these were Irish Dominion League and the Irish Centre Party. As such, the southern rump of the IUA became increasingly fractured and in 1922 it lost its reason to exist with the establishment of the Irish Free State. Leading unionist figures, such as the Earl of Midleton,  Lord Dunraven, James Campbell and Horace Plunkett were appointed in December 1922 by WT Cosgrave to the Free State's first Senate. Amongst others, Horace Plunkett's home in County Dublin was then burnt down during the Irish Civil War  because of his involvement in the Irish Senate. The IUA helped form the Southern Irish Loyalist Relief Association to assist war refugees and claim compensation for damage to property. From 1921 IUA voters began to support the mainstream Cumann na nGaedheal party. In the 1923 election three formerly loyalist businessmen were elected as the Business and Professional Group. From 1921 to 1991 the proportion of Southern Irish Protestants declined from 10% to 3% of the population; these had provided the bulk of the IUA's support base. Unionists continued to have a majority on Rathmines Council until 1929, when the IUA's successors lost their last elected representatives in the Irish Free State.",

Even though the Tokugawa forces numbered some 38,000, an overwhelming advantage over the Sanada's mere 2,000, they were still unable to capture the strategist's well-defended position. At the same time, 15,000 Toyotomi troops were being held up by 500 troops under Hosokawa Y\u016bsai at Tanabe Castle in present-day Maizuru, Kyoto Prefecture. Some among the 15,000 troops respected Hosokawa so much they intentionally slowed their pace. Due to these incidents, a large number of troops from both sides failed to show up in time for the battle.

        "passage": "Many of the migrants from China in the 19th century came to work on the pepper and Uncaria gambir plantations, with 11,000 Chinese immigrants recorded in one year. Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, many of whom then settled in Singapore after their contract ended. By 1860, the total population had reached around 90,000, of these 50,000 were Chinese, and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians. The first thorough census in Singapore was undertaken in 1871, and the people were grouped into 33 racial, ethnic or national categories, with Chinese forming the largest group at 57.6%. Censuses were then conducted at 10 year intervals afterwards. The 1881 census grouped the people into 6 main categories, and further subdivided into 47 sub-categories. The 6 broad groups were given as Europeans, Eurasians, Malays, Chinese, Indians and Others in 1921. The Malays group includes other natives of the Malay archipelago, the Europeans include Americans, the Indians would be people from the Indian subcontinent including what would now be Pakistan and Bangladesh. In 1901, the total population of Singapore was 228,555, with 15.8% Malays, 71.8% Chinese, 7.8% Indians, and 3.5% Europeans and Eurasians. The Chinese population figure of Singapore has stayed at over 70% of the total since, reaching 77.8% in 1947. After dropping from a peak of 60% in the early years of Singapore, the Malay population would range between 11 and 16% in the first half of the 20th century, while Indians hovered between 7 and just over 9% in the same period.",

After falling behind in the all-time series to the Lions 4-12-1 through 1965, the Steelers' victory moved them to 13-2 against Detroit since 1966. The team also held an opponent without a touchdown on the road for the first time since their 28-12 victory over the Browns in 2015.",

        "passage": "The Portuguese tried again to put their preferred candidate on the throne of Kandy as a client ruler. This time it was Dona Catarina, a Kandyan princess who had been entrusted to the care of the Portuguese and brought up in a Catholic European style. She was then aged ten or twelve. Pedro Lopes de Sousa led a force of about 20,000 in an invasion of Kandy, of which one thousand were Portuguese troops , 15,400 native Lascarin allies, 47 elephants used as pack animals, and the remainder Badaga mercenaries from India and coolie labourers. The initial number of opposing Kandyan forces is unknown, but is estimated at 10,000. The defenders held a distinct advantage in the terrain, as Kandy is a mountainous region and the invading force would be forced to traverse well-defended mountain passes. The Portuguese stormed the pass at Balana with heavy losses, after which the Kandyan forces began to retreat before the invaders. The Portuguese were able to enter the capital Kandy without resistance, finding it abandoned by King Vimaladharmasuriya I. Dona Catarina was crowned as the new ruler of the Kingdom of Kandy. However she and her Portuguese advisers were unpopular rulers, particularly after rumours spread that she was to be married to a Portuguese husband . Vimaladharmasuriya's forces engaged in guerilla tactics, attacking Portuguese foraging parties and cutting off lines of supply and communication. A large Portuguese-Lascarin raiding party of 3,000 men was surrounded and destroyed in the Uva region. Shortly thereafter, evidence was found that Jayavira Bandara Mudali, one of the Lascarin chieftains, was preparing to betray the Portuguese to Vimaladharmasuriya. Part of this evidence was later shown to be fabricated by Vimaladharmasuriya, but Jayavira was killed as a traitor before this was realised.",

Later in the period, the Rams would get their only score of the game as WR Dante Hall returned a punt 85&#160;yards for a touchdown.  Afterwards, Dallas regained the lead with QB Tony Romo getting a 15-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Cowboys managed to put the game away with Romo hooking up with WR Patrick Crayton on a 59-yard and a 37-yard TD pass.  Afterwards, the scoring ended with Romo's 17-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten. With no touchdowns in their last 30 offensive possessions to go with their fourth-straight loss, the Rams fell to 0-4.",

        "passage": "Coming off their Monday night loss to the Saints, the Patriots traveled to Miami to face the Dolphins with a two-game lead in the division. The Patriots received the ball to start the game and six plays in, converted a 3rd-and-8 to keep the drive alive. On the next play, Brady threw a 58-yard touchdown pass to Moss to take an early 7-0 lead. Brady was injured on the play and went to the locker room but returned by the next offensive snap. In the mean time, the Dolphins' first possession reached the Patriots' 42-yard line before Henne was sacked by Banta-Cain and Mayo for a loss of seven yards. On the next play, the Dolphins used White in their \"pistol\" formation and attempted a play action option run, but White's option toss to Ricky Williams was errant and recovered by Williams for a loss of 13 yards. Following the Dolphins' punt, the Patriots began a 13-play, 80-yard drive with 6:41 left in the first quarter and did not surrender the ball until early in the second quarter, extending their lead to 14-0 on a 6-yard Faulk draw for a touchdown. The Dolphins responded with a 10-play, 88-yard drive of their own, including a 29-yard pass to Camarillo, that ended in a 13-yard touchdown pass from Henne to Davone Bess, cutting the Patriots' lead to 14-7. Despite a 16-yard Welker reception to begin the Patriots' next drive, they were forced to punt after four plays. The Dolphins again moved into Patriots territory on their ensuing possession, reaching the 49-yard line before Henne was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 19-yard line. Following a 19-yard return, a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Wilfork, and a false start penalty on Watson, the Patriots' next drive began at their own 18-yard line. The Patriots quickly moved into the red zone on a 58-yard Welker catch, but on a 4th-and-1 from the 6-yard line, the Patriots tried to convert, and Morris was stopped short of the first down marker. Off the turnover and with under two minutes remaining, the Dolphins moved 83 yards on 11 plays, cutting the Patriots' halftime lead to 14-10 on a 29-yard Carpenter field goal. The Dolphins, who had deferred the opening coin toss, chose to receive at the start of the second half but went three-and-out. On the next play (after a penalty), Brady threw a short sideline pass to Aiken, who caught the ball over the defender and proceeded to run down the sideline for an 81-yard touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 21-10. It was the third 50+ yard completion of the game for Brady, a career first, and the third longest completion of Brady's career. He also eclipsed 30,000 career passing yards on the play. Following a 51-yard kickoff return by Ted Ginn, Jr., the Dolphins took two plays to reach Patriots territory. On a 3rd-and-4 from the Patriots' 46-yard line, Henne attempted a deep sideline pass to wide receiver Brian Hartline, who stopped and turned back to catch the ball but was taken down by Wilhite for a 37-yard defensive pass interference penalty. However, the Pats surrendered only three yards and forced the Dolphins to kick a field goal; Carpenter's 24-yard score cut the Patriots' lead to 21-13. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Dolphins continued to pressure the Patriots defense, moving 64 yards on 12 plays and cutting the deficit to two points on a 7-yard Hartline touchdown catch. The Dolphins attempted to tie the game on a two-point conversion pass attempt to Fasano, but the pass fell incomplete. The Patriots' next drive reached the Dolphins' 39-yard line, where the Patriots again attempted to convert a fourth down, this one with three yards to gain. The Patriots appeared to do so at first, as Welker caught a 13-yard pass from Brady, but the play was nullified by an Aiken offensive pass interference penalty. After another penalty on the first punt attempt, the second punt attempt by Hanson actually gave the Patriots a better break, pinning the Dolphins at their own 3-yard line at the end of the third quarter. The Dolphins could not move past their 22-yard line on the ensuing possession and punted, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 39-yard line. After several quick first downs, the Patriots reached the red zone. However, a Brady pass attempt intended for Moss in the back corner of the end zone was intercepted by Vontae Davis for a touchback, maintaining a two-point deficit for the Dolphins. However, the Dolphins could not move a yard off the turnover and were forced to punt; the Patriots too went three-and-out. The Dolphins moved to the Patriots' 39-yard line on their ensuing possession, and like the Patriots, faced a fourth down with two yards to go. Henne's pass intended for Bess was broken up by Butler to turn the ball over on downs. However, the Patriots did not gain a yard, and in fact lost one yard on their next possession, setting up a Dolphins possession with 3:44 left in the game. The Dolphins moved 51 yards on 10 plays, reaching the Patriots' 23-yard line with just over one minute remaining. Carpenter then hit a 41-yard field goal to put the Dolphins ahead for the first time in the game, 22-21. Only needing a field goal, the Patriots tried to set up a Gostkowski attempt with under a minute to go, but three plays into their drive Brady was hit as he threw and was intercepted by linebacker Channing Crowder to seal a Dolphins victory. The back-to-back losses were a first for the Patriots since November 2006, and dropped their record to 7-5, while the Dolphins improved to 6-6 and within a game of first place in the division.",

        "passage": "Since the end of World War II, in part due to industrial size and the onset of the Cold War, the United States has often been a proponent of reduced tariff-barriers and free trade. The U.S. helped establish the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  and later the World Trade Organization ; although it had rejected an earlier version in the 1950s . Since the 1970s, U.S. governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement  in the 1990s, the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement  in 2006, and a number of bilateral agreements . In Europe, six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community  in 1951 which became the European Economic Community  in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and establishing a customs union between its member states. After expanding its membership, the EEC became the European Union  in 1993. The European Union, now the world's largest single market, has concluded free trade agreements with many countries around the world.",

        "passage": "(2012 Jacksonville Jaguars season)The Texans entered their first division clash of the season looking to establish their will on the ground.  Behind a punishing ground attack with Arian Foster and Ben Tate, as well as an efficient defensive effort led by second year defensive lineman J.J. Watt, the Texans dominated the game with a time of possession of 43:17 on their way to a 27-7 victory in Jacksonville.  With the win, the Texans improved to 2-0 for the 3rd straight season. On the first drive, Houston drove 60 yards aided by Tate and took a 3-0 lead on a Shayne Graham 31 yard field goal. The Jaguars mounted a drive into Texan territory but they had to punt from the 44. Both teams went three-and-out on their next drive.  After a long pass play, the Texans were at the 1. 2 plays later Arian Foster ran it in from the 1 to make it 10-0. Two drives later Houston scored on an 8-yard run from Ben Tate. At halftime it was 17-0 Texans. In the 3rd quarter, quarterback Matt Schaub threw an interception returned to the Houston 37. Jacksonville scored in just 2 plays on a Td pass from Blaine Gabbert to running back Maurice-Jones Drew. It was 17-7. Then the Texans made a 17 play drive resulting in a 2-yard Ben Tate touchdown to make it 24-7. The Texans would get a field goal to make it 27-7, and that would end the game.",

Following his first insurrection in May 1919, Sheykh Mahmud was imprisoned and eventually exiled to India for a one-year period. When returning, he was once again appointed a governor, but shortly revolted again declaring himself as the ruler of the Kingdom of Kurdistan. The Kingdom of Kurdistan lasted from September 1922 - July 1924. With British forces greatly exceeding his in ammunition and training, the defeat finally subdued the region to central British Iraqi rule in 1924. Sheykh Mahmud retreated into mountains, and eventually reached terms with the independent Kingdom of Iraq in 1932, over his return from the underground. Sheykh Mahmud revolts are considered the first chapter of the modern Iraqi-Kurdish conflict.",

        "passage": "Charleston, North Charleston, Goose Creek, and Hanahan are home to branches of the United States military. During the Cold War, the Naval Base  became the third largest U.S. homeport, with 23,500 Navy and Marine personnel, and 13,200 civilians serving over 80 ships and submarines. In addition, the combined facilities of the Naval Base and Weapons Station created the largest U.S. submarine port.  The Charleston Naval Shipyard repaired frigates, destroyers, cruisers, submarine tenders, and submarines. Also during this period, the shipyard conducted refueling of nuclear submarines. The Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet's loadout base for all nuclear ballistic missile submarines. Two SSBN \"Boomer\" squadrons and a submarine tender were homeported at the Weapons Station, while one SSN attack squadron, Submarine Squadron 4, and a submarine tender were homeported at the Naval Base. At the 1996 closure of the station's Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic , over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their UGM-27 Polaris, UGM-73 Poseidon, and UGM-96 Trident I delivery missiles  were stored and maintained, guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps security force company. In 2010, the Air Force base  and Naval Weapons Station  merged to form Joint Base Charleston. Today, Joint Base Charleston, supporting 53 military commands and federal agencies, provides service to over 79,000 airmen, sailors, soldiers, Marines, coast guardsmen, Department of Defense civilians, dependents, and retirees.",

        "passage": "An important element the Revolution's legacy is the 1917 Constitution. It was pushed forward by populist generals within Carranza's government to undermine the popular support that Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata held. It was not written by liberal elites or the military itself, but rather young radicalized professionals, giving the document some authenticity for the peasantry. The document brought numerous reforms demanded by populist factions of the revolution, with article 27 empowering the state to expropriate resources deemed vital to the nation. These included expropriation of hacienda lands and redistribution to peasants. Article 27 also empowered the government to expropriate holdings of foreign companies, most prominently seen in the 1938 expropriation of oil. In Article 123 the constitution codified major labor reforms, including an 8-hour work day, a right to strike, equal pay laws for women, and an end to exploitative practices such as child labor and company stores. The constitution strengthened restrictions on the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico. In the early 1990s, the government introduced reforms to the constitution that rolled back the government's power to expropriate property and its restrictions on religious institutions. Just as the government of Carlos Salinas de Gortari was amending significant provisions of the constitution, Metro Constituci\u00f3n de 1917 station was opened.",

He appointed a government commission \"to enquire without delay into the causes of discontent among the workers in the city of St Petersburg and its suburbs\" in view of the strike movement. The commission was headed by Senator NV\u00a0Shidlovsky, a member of the State Council, and included officials, chiefs of government factories, and private factory owners. It was also meant to have included workers' delegates elected according to a two-stage system. Elections of the workers delegates were, however, blocked by the socialists who wanted to divert the workers from the elections to the armed struggle. On 5 March\u00a0\u00a01905, the Commission was dissolved without having started work. Following the assassination of his uncle, the Grand Duke Sergei Aleksandrovich, on 17 February\u00a0\u00a01905, the Tsar made new concessions. On 18 February\u00a0\u00a01905 he published the Bulygin Rescript, which promised the formation of a consultative assembly, religious tolerance, freedom of speech  and a reduction in the peasants' redemption payments. On 24 and 25 May\u00a0\u00a01905, about 300 Zemstvo and municipal representatives held three meetings in Moscow, which passed a resolution, asking for popular representation at the national level. On 6 June\u00a0\u00a01905, Nicholas II had received a Zemstvo deputation. Responding to speeches by Prince Sergei Trubetskoi and Mr Fyodrov, the Tsar confirmed his promise to convene an assembly of people's representatives.",

This angered the Kingdom of Serbia and its patron, the Pan-Slavic and Orthodox Russian Empire. Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to be known as the \"powder keg of Europe.\" In 1912 and 1913, the First Balkan War was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting Treaty of London further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian state while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, and Southern Dobruja to Romania in the 33-day Second Balkan War, further destabilising the region. The Great Powers were able to keep these Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond.",

The second unit, under the command of Phraya Phra Khlang, had 50,000 troops to capture Dawei. Dawei and Tenasserim were cities in Thailand during Sukhothai period, which the Burmese had captured. However, the Governor of Tenasserim learned of the Siamese plans and sent an urgent message to the King of Pagu, Nanda Bayin, who ordered an army to oppose the Siamese.:139-140 Tenasserim resisted the siege for 15 days while the siege of Dawei lasted 20 days, before the Siamese were successful in capturing both cities. Both consented to be subject to Ayutthaya as in the past.:140 After Phraya Chakri captured Tenasserim city, he captured Mergui and the boats in the port, which included 3 foreign sloops and 150 other boats. He then sent Phraya Thep Archun by sea to Tavoy so as to assist Phraya Phra Khlang if the Burmese advanced that far. Phraya Chakri then marched with a force of 30,000 to Tavoy by land, leaving a garrison of 10,000 at Tenasserim under Phraya Sri Sainarong. Simultaneously, Phraya Phra Khlang sent 100 boats and 5,000 men under Phraya Phichai Songkhram and Phraya Ram Khamhaeng to assist Phraya Chakri.:141 The Burmese had sent 200 boats and 10,000 men under the command of Samin Ubkong and Samin Phataba. This Burmese flotilla was caught in the middle of the Siamese flotillas advancing from the north and south. Many Burmese boats were sunk, some beached their boats and fled, while the rest sailed away. Saming Ubakong was killed and 500 men were captured.:141-142",

Similar to the Houston game, the Eagles would proceed to destroy the Giants offense with 8 sacks and amass over 400 yards on the Giants defense going a 24-point scoring run. However, in the 4th quarter, the Eagles completely collapsed on offense with a Brian Westbrook fumble, dropped passes and the inability to convert key 3rd downs to run out the clock. The defense failed to capitalize on a Plaxico Burress fumble in the redzone which turned into a touchdown for the Giants. The Eagles also began giving Eli Manning time to connect with his receivers downfield. Towards the end of regulation, Eagles defensive end Trent Cole was flagged for a personal foul which allowed Giants kicker Jay Feely to tie the game with a field goal. The game proceeded to overtime with the Eagles offensive woes continuing and the defense allowing the Giants to score a miraculous touchdown on 3rd a long from Manning to Burress. To add to the loss, the Eagles lost Jevon Kearse for the remainder of the season with a knee injury.",

        "passage": "In 1918, the castle became the seat of the president of the new Czechoslovak Republic, T.G. Masaryk. The New Royal Palace and the gardens were renovated by Slovenian architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik. In this period the St Vitus Cathedral was finished .  Renovations continued in 1936 under Ple\u010dnik's successor Pavel Jan\u00e1k. On March 15, 1939, shortly after the Nazi Germany forced Czech President Emil Hacha  to hand his nation over to the Germans, Adolf Hitler spent a night in the Prague Castle, \"proudly surveying his new possession.\" During the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II, Prague Castle became the headquarters of Reinhard Heydrich, the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. According to a popular rumor, he is said to have placed the Bohemian crown on his head; old legends say a usurper who places the crown on his head is doomed to die within a year. Less than a year after assuming power, on May 27, 1942, Heydrich was attacked during Operation Anthropoid, by British-trained Slovak and Czech soldiers while on his way to the Castle, and died of his wounds - which became infected - a week later. Klaus, his firstborn son, died the next year in a traffic accident, also in line with the legend. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia and the coup in 1948, the Castle housed the offices of the communist Czechoslovak government. After Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the castle became the seat of the Head of State of the new Czech Republic.  Similar to what Masaryk did with Ple\u010dnik, president V\u00e1clav Havel commissioned Bo\u0159ek \u0160\u00edpek to be the architect of post-communism Prague Castle's necessary improvements, in particular of the facelift of the castle's gallery of paintings.",

        "passage": "In week three, Chicago hosted the 2-0 Pittsburgh Steelers, who trailed the all-time series 18-7-1 and had not defeated the Bears since 2005. WBBM-TV writer Jeff Joniak described the Bears as in \"clean-up mode\" after a poor performance in Tampa. The battle between the Bears' rushing attack and the Steelers' run defense featured the former averaging just 2.9 yards per carry (27th in the league) taking on a defense that allowed just 74 yards per game and 3.3 yards per carry. Joniak added Chicago's running game should try to make progress on early downs to allow Mike Glennon to succeed against Pittsburgh. Defensively, Joniak wrote the Bears had \"their hands full\" as Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was aided by receivers Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant, running back Le'Veon Bell, and tight end Jesse James. In spite of Pittsburgh's success in contrast with Chicago's struggles, a common belief was that the Steelers would often \"play down to their competition,\" one that was spurned in the wake of Glennon's 2014 Buccaneers upsetting the Steelers 27-24. The first two drives of the game ended with punts, but on the Bears' first punt of the game, Steelers returner Eli Rogers muffed the ball and Sherrick McManis recovered. Jordan Howard would score a three-yard touchdown run on the drive. On the Steelers' next drive, Roethlisberger was sacked by Bryce Callahan and fumbled, with Akiem Hicks recovering. The takeaway failed to result in points, however, as Connor Barth missed a 47-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Roethlisberger threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Brown, which the Bears responded via Glennon's two-yard touchdown pass to Adam Shaheen. On the final play of the first half, Chris Boswell's 35-yard field goal was blocked by McManis into Marcus Cooper's hands. Cooper raced down the field before suddenly slowing down before he reached the end zone, which allowed Pittsburgh's Vance McDonald to knock the ball away at the one-yard line. The ball was then batted out of the end zone, which led to a penalty against the Steelers and an untimed play for the Bears. A false start penalty on Charles Leno Jr. prompted the Bears to instead kick a 24-yard field goal. In the second half, the Bears suffered their first turnover of the game when Howard was stripped by Ryan Shazier; the Steelers took advantage to score on Bell's one-yard touchdown run. A second giveaway occurred when Glennon's pass for Zach Miller was intercepted by J. J. Wilcox, which enabled the Steelers to tie the game on Boswell's 32-yard field goal. The game remained scoreless through the rest of the half, resulting in overtime. After winning the coin toss to start overtime with the ball, the Bears quickly scored on the second play of the series; Tarik Cohen broke through for a 73-yard touchdown run, but was ruled to have stepped out of bounds at the Steelers' 37-yard line. Two plays later, Howard scored the game-winning touchdown on a 19-yard run. In claiming their first victory of the season, the Bears' running backs provided a solid performance, recording a combined 220 yards on the ground - 200 yards more than in week two. The defense also shone, forcing two turnovers after having just one in the first two games.",

        "passage": "In 1916 Romania entered World War I on the side of the Allies. In doing so, Romania's goal was to unite all the territories with a Romanian national majority into one state. In the Treaty of Bucharest , terms for Romania's acquisition of territories within Austria-Hungary were stipulated. In 1918, after the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks signed a separate peace with the Central Powers in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Romania was alone on the Eastern Front, a situation that far surpassed its military capabilities. Therefore, on 7 May 1918, Romania sued for peace. The prime minister of Romania, Alexandru Marghiloman, signed the Treaty of Bucharest  with the Central Powers. However, this treaty was never signed by King Ferdinand of Romania. At the end of 1918 Romania's situation was dire. She was suffering from the consequences of punitive war reparations. Dobruja was under Bulgarian occupation. The German army under the command of Field Marshal August von Mackensen was retreating through Romania. The bulk of the Romanian army was demobilized, leaving only four full-strength divisions. A further eight divisions were left in a reserve status. The four battle-ready divisions were used to keep order and protect Basarabia from possible hostile actions of the Soviet Union. On 10 November 1918, taking advantage of the Central Powers' precarious situation, Romania re-entered the war on the side of the Allied forces, with similar objectives to those of 1916. King Ferdinand called for the mobilization of the Romanian army and ordered it to attack by crossing the Carpathian Mountains into Transylvania. The end of World War I that soon followed did not bring an end to  fighting for the Romanian army. Its action continued into 1918 and 1919 in the Hungarian-Romanian war.",

In 1501 Feriz Beg captured Durazzo in Venetian Albania. By the end of 1502, Venice and the Ottoman Empire agreed on an armistice. On 31 January 1503, Venice signed another treaty with Vladislaus II, having already paid 124,000 ducats through the previous treaty, to pay 30,000 ducats a year for the same purpose. In 1503, Turkish cavalry raids reached Venetian territory in Northern Italy, and Venice was forced to recognize the Ottoman gains, ending the war. The economy of the Venetian cities in Dalmatia was severely impacted by the Turkish occupation of the hinterland during this war.",

Soviet POWs were kept in especially unbearable condition, and, although their extermination was not an official goal, 3.6 million of Soviet POWs out of 5.7 died in Nazi camps during the war. In addition to concentration camps, death camps were created in Nazi Germany to exterminate people at an industrial scale.Nazi Germany extensively used forced labourers. About 12 million  Europeans from German occupied countries were used as slave work force in German agriculture and war economy. Soviet Gulag became de facto a system of deadly camps during 1942-43, when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates, including foreign citizens of Poland and other countries occupied in 1939-40 by the USSR, as well as of the Axis POWs.By the end of the war, most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to NKVD check, and significant part of them was sent to Gulag as real or perceived Nazi collaborators.",

        "passage": "The English Civil War had left resentment among some of the population about the monarchy and the penalties which had been imposed on the supporters of the Commonwealth. The South West of England contained several towns where opposition remained strong. Fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife to produce any children. A defrocked Anglican clergyman, Titus Oates, spoke of a \"Popish Plot\" to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne. The Earl of Shaftesbury, a former government minister and a leading opponent of Catholicism, attempted to have James excluded from the line of succession. Some members of Parliament even proposed that the crown go to Charles's illegitimate son, James Scott, who became the Duke of Monmouth. In 1679, with the Exclusion Bill - which would exclude the King's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, from the line of succession - in danger of passing, Charles II dissolved Parliament. Two further Parliaments were elected in 1680 and 1681, but were dissolved for the same reason. After the Rye House Plot of 1683, an attempt to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and gathered supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, where he had been greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne. The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes.",

King Intharacha of Ayutthaya forced the former Kingdom of Sukhothai to recognize his authority in 1410. The king then invaded Lan Na in 1411, seizing Chiang Rai but failing to capture Chiang Mai and Phayao. In the latter battle the two sides may have used early cannons. In 1424 King Borommarachathirat II ascended the throne of Ayutthaya. After a seven-month siege, he captured Angkor by treachery in 1431. The Khmer retook the city in 1432 and subsequently transferred their capital to Phnom Penh. The sixth son of the Lan Na king Sam Fang Kaen, Thao Lok, ascended the throne in the aftermath of coup against his father in 1441. Thao Lok was crowned as king Tilokaraj of Lan na, later banishing his father Sam Fang Kaen to Muong Shan in the Shan States. General Phya Samdekyoki, who had previously played an important role in bringing Tilokaraj to power created a plot in order to assume power himself, the plot was however discovered and Samdekyoki was exiled to Chiang Saen.",

In the first quarter, the Eagles drew first blood as running back Brian Westbrook got a 5-yard TD run (which was set up on a fumbled punt attempt), while kicker David Akers kicked a 27-yard field goal after a quarterback Drew Bledsoe fumble.  The Cowboys would score in the period, as running back Marion Barber got a 2-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Cowboys OLB Greg Ellis sacked QB Donovan McNabb, causing him to fumble, which was picked up by OLB DeMarcus Ware who returned it 69 yards for a touchdown. McNabb would make up for his fumble by getting a 1-yard touchdown on a QB sneak after a long completion to L.J. Smith.  However, the Eagles trailed at halftime, as Bledsoe ran 7 yards for a score. In the third quarter, Philadelphia would get back on top, as McNabb threw an 87-yard bomb to rookie wide receiver Hank Baskett.  In the fourth quarter, the Cowboys evened the score with a Mike Vanderjagt 39-yard field goal.  The Eagles responded with a 40-yard McNabb to Reggie Brown flea-flicker touchdown. With Dallas threatening to tie the score late in the game, cornerback Lito Sheppard, who already had an interception, returned a Bledsoe pass 102 yards for a touchdown. With their 38-24 victory, Philadelphia managed to take the lead in the NFC East. McNabb finished with 354 yards, two passing TDs and one rushing TD, while Owens was a nonfactor with only 3 catches for 45 yards and several drops. Stats The win ended the Eagles seven-game losing streak to their division rivals.",

Green Bay accumulated a big lead with two touchdown catches by Jordy Nelson for eight and later 17 yards, one by Richard Rodgers from two-yards, as well as a 36-yard field goal from Mason Crosby. Detroit made the halftime score 31-10 after Marvin Jones caught a 17-yard touchdown catch from Matthew Stafford. After the break, the Lions attempted a comeback with touchdown catches by Anquan Boldin and Marvin Jones, from two and 45-yards respectively, as well a 50-yard Prater field goal. Despite only allowing a 46-yard Packers field goal in the second half, the Lions came up short, losing  27-34.",

        "passage": "After a lull in violence in the north over the new year, killings there intensified again in the spring of 1921. The northern IRA units came under pressure from the leadership in Dublin to step up attacks in line with the rest of the country. Predictably, this unleashed loyalist reprisals against Catholics. For example, in April 1921, the IRA in Belfast shot dead two Auxiliaries in Donegal Place in Belfast city centre. The same night, two Catholics were killed on the Falls Road. On 10 July 1921 the IRA ambushed British forces in Raglan street in Belfast. In the following week, sixteen Catholics were killed and 216 Catholic homes burned in reprisal - events known as Belfast's Bloody Sunday. Killings on the loyalist side were largely carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force , allegedly with the aid of the RIC and especially the auxiliary police force, the Ulster Special Constabulary or \"B-Specials\". The Special Constabulary , was largely recruited from Ulster Volunteer Force and Orange Lodges and, in the words of historian Michael Hopkinson, \"amounted to an officially approved UVF\". In May James Craig came to Dublin to meet the British Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord FitzAlan, and was smuggled by the IRA through Dublin to meet \u00c9amon de Valera. The two leaders discussed the possibility of a truce in Ulster and an amnesty for prisoners. Craig proposed a compromise settlement based on the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, with limited independence for the South and autonomy for the North within a Home Rule context. However, the talks came to nothing and violence in the north continued.",

        "passage": "In the south too, the Mon-speaking kingdom based out of Martaban had slowly come into its own. It formally broke away from its overlord Sukhothai in 1330. The southern kingdom's relationship with Sukhothai had always been an opportunistic arrangement from the beginning, designed to secure its rear in case of invasions from Upper Burma. In March 1298, just four years after he became a vassal of Sukhothai, when the Upper Burma ceased to be a threat, Wareru conveniently asked for and received recognition directly from the Mongol emperor as governor even though Sukhothai itself was already a vassal of the Mongols. Indeed, when Sukhothai grew weaker, Martaban seized the Tenasserim coast from Sukhothai in 1319. A decade later, Sukhothai tried to reassert control, reoccupying Tenasserim, and attacking Martaban in 1330. Martaban's defences held. It threw off any formal ties with Sukhothai. Nonetheless, the kingdom remained fragmented into three power centres: the Irrawaddy delta in the west, Pegu in the middle and Martaban in the southeast, each with its own chief, who pledged nominal allegiance to the high king. In 1363, Martaban revolted, and outlasted Pegu's armies. After six years, Pegu gave up. Martaban would be independent for another 20 years until 1389.",

        "passage": "This matchup on Christmas Eve against the crosstown rival New York Jets was considered the most important ever. Both teams needed to win their last two games to make the playoffs. Trailing 7-3 in the second quarter and facing third and ten from their own one-yard line, Eli Manning threw a short out pass to Victor Cruz. Cruz broke two tackles and then took off for the end zone, outrunning the remaining Jet defenders on his way to a record-tying 99-yard touchdown reception and a 10-7 lead which the Giants never looked back from. Ahmad Bradshaw rushed for two touchdowns, Chris Canty forced an intentional grounding penalty in the endzone on Mark Sanchez resulting in a safety, and Lawrence Tynes added two field goals to give the Giants their fifth consecutive regular season victory over the Jets and set up a winner-take-all season finale against the Cowboys. Manning, although he did not have his best game, recorded 225 yards and a touchdown while Cruz's three receptions garnered him 164 of those. Sanchez threw a career-high 59 passes for 258 yards and a touchdown to Josh Baker but was intercepted twice. Dustin Keller led all receivers with eight receptions while Shonn Greene just barely outgained Bradshaw with 58 yards.",

In the first quarter the Jets trailed early as kicker Robbie Gould got a 37-yard field goal, followed by Matt Forte getting a 22-yard TD run. The Jets pulled ahead with RB Shonn Greene getting a 3-yard TD run, followed by CB Dwight Lowery returning an interception 20 yards for a touchdown, followed by RB LaDainian Tomlinson getting a 3-yard TD run letting the Jets lead 21-10. The lead was narrowed as QB Jay Cutler scrambled 2 yards for a touchdown, but was soon extended as kicker Nick Folk made a 26-yard field goal. They trailed again with Cutler completing a 40 and a 25-yard TD pass to wide receivers Devin Hester and Johnny Knox respectively, but soon were able to tie the game with QB Mark Sanchez throwing a 23-yard TD pass to WR Santonio Holmes. The Bears escaped the tie with Cutler finding Knox again on a 26-yard TD pass. The Jets tried to come back, but only came away with a 34-yard field goal from Folk. When the Jets got the ball back, Sanchez threw a pass intended for Holmes, only to be intercepted by safety Chris Harris with 0:58 to go. With the loss, the Jets fell to 10-5, but clinched a playoff berth when the Jaguars lost to the Redskins..",

The fleet is considered to have been founded by Prince Potemkin on May 13, 1783. In 1918, the fleet was inherited by the Russian SFSR then the Soviet Union in 1922, where it became part of the Soviet Navy. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Black Sea Fleet and most of its vessels were inherited by the Russian Federation. The Black Sea Fleet's official primary headquarters and facilities are located in the city of Sevastopol, which is de jure part of Ukraine but de facto part of Russia . The remainder of the fleet's facilities are based in various locations on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, including Krasnodar Krai, Rostov Oblast and Crimea. The current commander is Admiral Aleksandr Viktorovich Vitko, who has held the position since April 2013.",

        "passage": "After British imperial forces withdrew from most Canadian locations in 1870-71, the militia authorized the creation of two batteries of garrison artillery which provided garrison duties and schools of gunnery. \"A \" Battery School of Gunnery was established at T\u00eate-de-Pont Barracks and other locations in Kingston . These batteries were known as the Regiment of Canadian Artillery.  When this regiment evolved into the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery , its headquarters was at the T\u00eate-de-Pont Barracks from 1905 to 1939. After the RCHA left for operational duties during the Second World War, the fort was used as a personnel depot. In 1939 the site of the fort again became known as Fort Frontenac. Canadian Army staff training began at Fort Frontenac when the Canadian Army Staff College moved to the fort from the Royal Military College in 1948. The college is now known as the Canadian Army Command and Staff College. Fort Frontenac was also the location of the National Defence College until 1994. Fort Frontenac was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1923.",

        "passage": "Historically, the first official plan for the creation of Cossack formations as a border service was brought to the State Council of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1524 by Semen Polozovic and Kristof Kmitic. However, due to the lack of funds, the idea was not realized. The starosta of Cherkasy, Ostap Dashkevych, revived the idea at the 1533 council in Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski. Dashkevych tried to show that in order to protect the borders beyond the Dnieper it would be necessary to maintain an army of 2,000 soldiers and several hundred cavalrymen. He pointed out the importance of establishing forts on the river's islands to keep Tatar raids in check. On July 21, 1541 the King of Poland, Sigismund I the Old, issued an edict to the starosta of Cherkasy, Andrei Glebovich Pronsky , in which he strictly warned Pronsky to control the Cossack raids against Tatar uluses. With the start of the Livonian War in the 16th century, the voivode of Kiev, Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski, and the starosta of Cherkasy, Alexander Wisnowecki, recruited Cossacks to their armies, while in 1568 King Sigismund II Augustus sent a proposition to the Zaporizhian Sich to join his foreign campaign and sign up for royal service. Sigismund II Augustus decreed the formation of registered Cossacks on June 5, 1572 when the King confirmed the orders of Great Crown Hetman Jerzy Jaz\u0142owiecki, the voivode of Podole and Ruthenia, for state service. The first Hetman of the Registered Cossacks and court marshal was Jan Badowski. The registered Cossacks were the only military Cossack formation recognized by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.",

In the first quarter, Tony Romo made a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Roy Williams. In the second quarter, Marion Barber made a 3-yard touchdown run. The Cowboys ended the first half of the game holding Washington to no points. The Cowboys got a 23-yard field goal in the second half by their new kicker Shaun Suisham who had played for the Redskins prior to the game. The Redskins continued to be scoreless and ended the game being shut out. This was the first shutout victory over the Redskins since the Cowboys beat them 27-0 on December 14, 2003, and the first time they swept the Redskins since the 2004 season. With the victory, the Cowboys clinched a spot in the playoffs and improved from their final 9-7 record from the previous season. The win also closed the door on the 8-7 New York Giants, who had a 41-9 loss to the Carolina Panthers earlier that day. With the win, the Cowboys improved to 10-5.",

During the Second World War, the term was temporarily extended to ten years by Acts of Parliament. Since the end of the war the maximum has remained five years. Modern Parliaments, however, rarely continued for the maximum duration; normally, they were dissolved earlier. For instance, the 52nd, which assembled in 1997, was dissolved after four years.

The DIG  suggested the names of Yogendra Shukla, Basawon Singh , Shyamdeo Narayan alias Ram Singh, Ishwar Dayal Singh, Kedar Mani Shukla, Mohit Chandra Adhikari and Ram Pratap Singh. Yogendra Shukla, Kedar Mani Shukla and Shyamdeo Narayan were transferred to the Andamans in December, 1932. In 1937, Yogendra Shukla was transferred to Hazaribagh Central Jail as a result of his 46 days of hunger strike. When Sri Krishna Sinha formed the first Congress ministry in 1937, he took up the cause of political prisoners and his ministry resigned on the issue on 15 February 1938. As a result, the Viceroy conceded the demands and Yogendra Shukla along with other political prisoners was released in March, 1938.",

        "passage": "Vest Recklinghausen was first mentioned in 1228 as a fiefdom of the Archbishopric of Cologne and thus it belonged to the Electoral Rhenish Circle. The administrator lived in castle Westerholt, located in Herten. From 1446 to 1576 it was used as collateral, first pawned to the lords of Gemen  and after 1492 to the Lords of Schauenburg and Holstein-Pinneberg, who pawned the territory back to the Archbishops of Cologne in 1576. During the Cologne War , Vest Recklinghausen was occupied and sacked several times by troops from both sides of the conflict. In 1583, although much of the territory was already Protestant, the Calvinist Elector of Cologne, Gebhard, Truchsess von Waldburg and his wife, Agnes, ordered the destruction of the icons and decorative elements of the churches. In 1584, the territory was sacked again, this time by the competing archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria. In 1586, the territory was invaded by Martin Schenck and Hermann Cloedt, who caused great damage to the farms and small villages, and were besieged by Claude de Berlaymont, also known as Haultpenne, in the city of Werl.",

Baltimore gained the lead in the second quarter as Stover kicked a 20-yard field goal, while rookie quarterback Joe Flacco completed his first career touchdown pass as he hooked up with TE Daniel Wilcox from 4 yards out. In the third quarter, Pittsburgh took the lead with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing a 38-yard TD pass to WR Santonio Holmes, along with LB James Harrison forcing a fumble from Flacco with LB LaMarr Woodley returning the fumble 7 yards for a touchdown.  In the fourth quarter, the Steelers increased their lead with Reed getting a 19-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Ravens tied the game with RB Le'Ron McClain getting a 2-yard TD run.  However, despite winning the coin toss in overtime, Baltimore was unable to gain ground.  In the end, Pittsburgh sealed Baltimore's fate as Reed nailed the game-winning 46-yard field goal.",

Present and former teammates, opponents, fans, executives, TV and radio show hosts quickly came to Manning's defense. It was also the first time a Manning did not start in an NFL game since Week 17 of the 1997 NFL season. An attempted comeback fell short dropping the Giants to 2-10, their worst record since 1976. Geno completed 21-34 passes for 212 yards and 1 touchdown and lost 2 redzone fumbles. The following day, the Giants announced that Head Coach Ben McAdoo and General Manager Jerry Reese had been relieved of their duties.",

The Lions entered the game having already clinched a playoff spot, thanks to the Washington Redskins' win over the Philadelphia Eagles the previous day.  Each team scored a touchdown in the first half. First Detroit's Reggie Bush ran one in from 13 yards out in the first quarter, then Chicago's Matt Forte caught an 11-yard pass from Jimmy Clausen late in the second quarter to tie it up at halftime. The Lions took the lead in the third quarter with a 39-yard field goal by Matt Prater, but the Bears went ahead with a 20-yard touchdown pass from Clausen to Alshon Jeffery. In the final quarter, Detroit scored 10 unanswered points for the victory: first a 17-yard touchdown run by Joique Bell, then a 30-yard field goal from Matt Prater. The win was the fifth of the season in which the Lions trailed entering the fourth quarter. It made the Lions 11-4 for the first time since 1991, and kept them undefeated against divisional opponents.",

Playing in heavy rain with a delay due to lightning, the game remained scoreless through 59&#160;minutes and 43&#160;seconds, becoming the longest scoreless tie since November 7, 1943. In the end, Pittsburgh came through with kicker Jeff Reed nailing the game-winning 24-yard field goal with 17&#160;seconds left for the game's lone points. With the win, the Steelers improved to 8-3.  Also, not only did they improve their home record to 6-0, but this also marked their 13th-straight home win on Monday Night Football.  This game would also be crowned as the lowest-scoring game in Monday Night Football history. It was the lowest scoring NFL game since December 11, 1993, when the New York Jets defeated Washington by the same score.",

        "passage": "The heavy French losses at the Battle of Gaouz encouraged an increase in tribal activity across the south-east of Morocco, threatening the French presence at Boudenib.  Poeymirau was forced to withdraw garrisons from outlying posts in the Tafilalt, including that at Tighmart, to concentrate his force and reduce the risk of further disasters.  Lyautey authorised only a series of limited offensives, such as the razing of villages and gardens, the primary aim of which was to emphasise French military superiority.  The French struggled to move troops through the mountain passes from the Moulouya Valley due to heavy snows and attacks on their columns, and Lyautey, to his embarrassment, was forced to request reinforcements from Algeria.  By October the situation had stabilised to the extent that Poeymirau was able to withdraw his troops to Meknes, but a large-scale uprising in January 1919 forced his return.  Poeymirau defeated n'Ifrutant in battle at Meski on 15 January, but was seriously wounded in the chest by the accidental explosion of an artillery shell and was forced to hand command to Colonel Antoine Hur\u00e9.  Lyautey then received assistance from Thami El Glaoui, a tribal leader who Lyautey had made Pasha of Marrakesh after the uprising of 1912.  El Glaoui owed his increasing wealth  to corruption and fraud, which the French tolerated in return for his support.  Thus committed to Lyautey's cause, El Glaoui led an army of 10,000 men, the largest Moroccan tribal force ever seen, across the Atlas to defeat anti-French tribesmen in the Dad\u00e8s Gorges and to reinforce the garrison at Boudenib on 29 January.  The uprising was over by 31 January 1919.",

        "passage": "The Bills' defense dominated the Browns in a 26-10 defeat.  The first half was low scoring; K Billy Cundiff made a 22-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  Several special teams errors occurred in the second quarter that prevented either team from scoring.  Cundiff missed a field goal and the Bills' K Dan Carpenter's 53 yard field goal try was blocked by S Joe Haden. The Bills dominated the second half, scoring 20 unanswered points to seize control.  The Bills scored a touchdown early in the third to go up 7-3. On the Browns' next drive, RB Terrance West fumbled, and the Bills recovered for a touchdown, adding a field goal in the 4th quarter to make it 17-3.  Hoyer threw an INT on the next drive, and the Bills kicked another field goal, building a 20-3 lead.  At that moment, Hoyer was benched for Johnny Manziel for the remainder of the game.  Manziel led an 80-yard touchdown drive on his first series, running for a touchdown to cut the deficit to 20-10. On Manziel's second drive, the Browns failed to gain a first down, turning the ball over on downs.  The Bills kicked 2 more field goals to make it 26-10, producing the final margin. With the loss, the Browns fell to 7-5, still in 4th place in the AFC North (due to tiebreakers). For Hoyer, this was the second consecutive game where he had 0 passing touchdowns and multiple interceptions. It was the Browns' first loss this season when holding a lead after the first half. The 26 points allowed by the Browns in the second half were the most points that they had surrendered in the second half of any game this season. Following the game, Browns coach Mike Pettine announced that he was uncertain who would start at QB against the Indianapolis Colts, but he would decide by Wednesday. WR Miles Austin was hospitalized at the end of the game for a kidney injury sustained from a helmet-leading tackle in the 2nd quarter. He was later ruled out for the remainder of the season.  On December 3, Pettine announced that Hoyer would start against the Colts.",

The Eagles offense drove 85&#160;yards to take the lead on a touchdown pass from Donovan McNabb to Correll Buckhalter. The Eagles defense sacked Ben Roethlisberger eight times throughout the game, two of which resulted in fumbles. Bryant McFadden intercepted his second pass of the season which allowed Reed to add his second field goal of the day&#8212;this one from 53-yards. The field goal brought the half time score to 10-6. A third quarter diving Troy Polamalu interception, on Kevin Kolb's first NFL pass, was named a \"Can't Miss Play\" by NFL Network. The Steelers did not capitalize, punting two more times in the third quarter. The Eagles entered the final quarter leading 10-6, and added two more points when Roethlisberger was called for Intentional grounding while in the end zone. Roethlisberger was forced to leave the game after his hand was stepped on in the final quarter. Offensive coordinator Bruce Arians took responsibility for the offense's performance. \"Anybody who wants anybody to blame for Philadelphia, you just blame me,\" Arians stated, \"and then we can get ready for Baltimore.\"",

        "passage": "Mantua is the ancestral city where the male line of the Gonzaga dynasty ruled, first as marquesses, then after 1540 as dukes, in vassalage to the Holy Roman Empire. Monferrato was a duchy since 1574 on the eastern side of Piedmont, and an Imperial fief since the eleventh or twelfth century. The Gonzagas had enlarged their realm with Monferrato after receiving it in dowry from the wife of duke Frederick II Gonzaga. On 22 September 1612, Francis IV, Duke of Mantua and Monferrato died at the age of 26. His death occurred only a couple of months after the death of his father Vincent I, Duke of Mantua. He left only a three-year-old daughter, Maria of Mantua. Francis IV also had two younger brothers who, both being cardinals, could not marry and were thus ineligible to succeed to Mantua's throne. Nonetheless, Francis' two brothers, Ferdinando I  and Vincenzo II , eventually did become Dukes of Mantua. Despite marrying, following the resignation of Ferdinando and the expulsion of Vincenzo from the Sacred College of Cardinals, neither produced any legitimate children. A crisis erupted when Vincenzo II died on 26 December 1627 at the age of 33, the same day that his niece Maria Gonzaga's marriage with Charles de Nevers was celebrated. Nevers was the eldest son and heir of Charles, Duke of Nevers, Rethel and Mayenne. Moreover, he was the head of the cadet branch of the House of Gonzaga, and after Vincenzo II, heir male of the Duchy of Mantua.",

        "passage": "Thomas Wentworth, now the Earl of Strafford, became a leading adviser to the King. He threw himself into Charles's plans with great energy and left no stone unturned to furnish the new military expedition with supplies and money. The Scots under Leslie and Montrose crossed the River Tweed, and Charles' army retreated before them. In a short time, the invaders overran the whole of Northumberland and County Durham . Charles had to leave the two counties in Scots hands as a pledge for the payment of Scots expenses when he agreed to peace and signed the Treaty of Ripon in October 1640. The impoverished King had to summon another parliament to grant him the supplies which he needed to make that payment; this Long Parliament attacked his Government, impeaching  his chief supporters, Strafford and Laud. It sat until purged in 1648. In the hopes of winning Scottish support, Charles went to Scotland in the autumn of 1641 where he gave titles to Leslie and Argyll, and accepted all the decisions of the General Assembly of 1638 and of the Scottish Parliament of 1641, including confirming the right of the Parliament to challenge the actions of his ministers. He had now withdrawn all the causes of the original dispute, but within a year his disputes with the English Parliament would lead to civil war.",

The Chiefs entered the game 2-2 for the season, while the Steelers were 1-3 with a three-game losing streak.  The game was broadcast on CBS 4:15&#160;p.m. Pittsburgh time. Trent Green would sit out for the fourth straight week.  Damon Huard would make his fourth consecutive start as he entered the game ranked second in the NFL in quarterback ratings,  while the Chiefs defense ranked in the top five in the NFL.  Larry Johnson recovered from his facemask tackle from Antrel Rolle and started as running back. Ben Roethlisberger threw his first touchdown of the season as the Chiefs defense gave up 372 total yards in the first half,  allowing 17 first downs.  Cornerback Ty Law made a costly error in the opening series by slipping on the turf, allowing Santonio Holmes to gain 50&#160;yards on the third play of the game.  Holmes would have scored if he had not slipped as well. The Chiefs managed one touchdown in the game, coming from Larry Johnson in the third quarter.  Following a 49-yard interception by safety Troy Polamalu, Larry Johnson stopped Polamalu by tackling him from his long hair.  Johnson was not penalized for pulling Polamalu down, but by pulling him back up by his hair (a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct). The Chiefs put in rookie quarterback Brodie Croyle in the final quarter, who managed an interception for a touchdown and a sack, as the Steelers ended the game with the 45-7 victory margin.",

In August 1920, the Polish army had reached a total strength of 737,767 soldiers; half of that was on the frontline.

The Titans got on the board first as K Rob Bironas connected on a 32-yard field goal five minutes into the game.  The Skins responded with a 10-yard touchdown run by RB Clinton Portis.  On the first play of the second quarter, Skins QB Mark Brunell hit TE Chris Cooley with a 24-yard touchdown pass.  Titans K Bironas converted a 26-yard field goal, and Young hit WR Brandon Jones with a 3-yard touchdown near the end of the first half, to pull the Titans to within one going into halftime.  Titans RB Travis Henry rushed for a career-high 178 yards and scored on a 2-yard run in the third quarter.  On the Skins next possession, Titans FB Casey Cramer blocked a Derrick Frost punt out of the end zone for a safety.   Skins RB Portis ran for his second touchdown early in the fourth quarter, and Brunell hit WR Santana Moss for the two-point conversion to tie the game at 22.  Titans K Bironas kicked a field goal from 30 yards out with 5 minutes left to give them a 25-22 lead.  The Skins had one last chance but Brunell threw an interception to S Lamont Thompson to seal the deal for the Titans.  With the win, the Titans went into their bye week at 1-5.",

        "passage": "The Panthers came into Week 5 again craving a win to get their season back on track. This time they were facing the former super bowl champions, the New Orleans Saints. The Saints were leading 10-0 with 3:04 left in the first quarter when Cam Newton threw a pass to wide receiver Steve Smith for a 54-yard touchdown after the touchdown Roman Harper was called for unnecessary roughness in the endzone. There would be a short fight after the play, and Olindo Mare would miss the extra point, it being blocked. With 4:01 left in the second quarter, the Panthers were trailing 17-6. Not when DeAngelo Williams took a left pitch from Cam Newton for a 69-yard score, Williams' first touchdown since 2009. Right before halftime, with 0:10 left, Sean Payton was trying to get the field goal unit out on the field for a John Kasay 46-yard field goal. Ron Rivera took a timeout because he thought he had too many men on the field, which would cost them a field goal which put the Saints up, 20-13. With 2:36 left in the third quarter, on a 2nd and 8, score 23-20 Saints, Drew Brees was intercepted by Sherrod Martin. Off of the interception, with 12:40 left in the game, on a 3rd and goal, Newton found Greg Olsen for a 5-yard touchdown to put the Panthers up 27-23. With 0:56 left in the game, Brees threw a short pass to Pierre Thomas for a six-yard score. Saints go up, 30-27. With 0:27 left, on a fourth-and-10, Cam Newton's pass is incomplete, intended for Greg Olsen, but there was a pass interference call on Roman Harper which set up a Panthers first down. Then, on a 3rd and 12 with 0:05 remaining, Cam Newton's pass, intended for Steve Smith is incomplete. With the close loss the Panthers fell to 1-4 on the season, though only being outscored 119-132 on the season.",

In addition, they tended to suspect that most civilians were potential francs-tireurs  and, accordingly, took and sometimes killed hostages from among the civilian population. The German army executed over 6,500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers. The German Army destroyed 15,000-20,000 buildings\u2014most famously the university library at Louvain\u2014and generated a wave of refugees of over a million people. Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents. Thousands of workers were shipped to Germany to work in factories. British propaganda dramatising the Rape of Belgium attracted much attention in the United States, while Berlin said it was both lawful and necessary because of the threat of franc-tireurs like those in France in 1870. The British and French magnified the reports and disseminated them at home and in the United States, where they played a major role in dissolving support for Germany.",

        "passage": "The Steelers stayed home for a game against the Jets. In the first quarter, the Jets took an early 3-0 lead when Nick Folk kicked a 30-yard field goal. Later on, the Steelers took the lead when Ben Roethlisberger found Sammie Coates for a 72-yard touchdown pass to make it 7-3. The Jets scored 10 straight points in the second quarter: Folk kicked a 48-yard field goal to come within a point, 7-6. This would be followed byRyan Fitzpatrick finding Brandon Marshall on a 15-yard touchdown pass to make it 13-7. The Steelers wrapped up the scoring of the half when Roethlisberger found Jesse James on a 1-yard touchdown pass to make it 14-13 at halftime. In the second half it was all Steelers. Starting in the third quarter, Chris Boswell put the team up by 4 with a 47-yard field goal to make it 17-13. In the fourth quarter, they would score 2 touchdowns: Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 5-yard pass and then Coates on another 5-yard pass to make the score 24-13 and the eventual final score 31-13. With the win, the Steelers improved to 4-1. With the Ravens' loss to the Redskins, the team is also now in outright first place in the AFC North. This would be the final game the Steelers would wear their 1934 throwback uniforms.",

Cincinnati would trail in the first quarter as Steelers kicker Jeff Reed got a 28-yard field goal.  The Bengals would immediately strike back as rookie running back Bernard Scott returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown.  In the second quarter, Pittsburgh would retake the lead with Reed's 33-yard and 35-yard field goals. Cincinnati would regain the lead in the third quarter with kicker Shayne Graham getting a 23-yard and a 32-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Steelers would tie the game with Reed booting a 34-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Bengals would pull away with Graham nailing a 32-yard and a 43-yard field goal. With the win, not only did the Bengals improve to 7-2, but they acquired their first season-sweep over Pittsburgh since 1998 as the Steelers fell to 6-3.",

        "passage": "Hoping to rebound from their Thursday night road loss to the Cowboys, the Packers went home for Favre's 250th (270th including playoffs) consecutive start, along with Green Bay's Week 14 interconference duel with the Oakland Raiders. After a scoreless first quarter, the Packers sliced away in the second quarter with rookie RB Ryan Grant getting a 6-yard TD run, while CB Will Blackmon returned a punt 57&#160;yards for a touchdown. The Raiders would end the half with their only score of the game as QB Josh McCown completed a 25-yard TD pass to WR Jerry Porter. In the third quarter, Green Bay took control with rookie Mason Crosby nailing a 44-yard field goal, QB Brett Favre completing an 80-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings, while Blackmon recovered an Oakland fumble in their endzone for a touchdown (making him the first player since Cincinnati's Lemar Parrish in 1974 to return a punt and a fumble for a touchdown in one game). In the fourth quarter, the Packers pulled away with Favre completing a 46-yard TD pass to TE Donald Lee. With the win, not only did Green Bay improve to 11-2, but they also clinched the NFC North division title. It was the Packers' 18th division title, along with their 24th playoff berth with three games remaining in the season - the second-fastest division title in team history. Blackmon was awarded NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors for his performance.",

        "passage": "The Falcons, making their first visit to Denver since 2004, took a 10-0 lead in the first quarter, with running back Devonta Freeman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown, followed by a 46-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Bryant. The Broncos, with quarterback Paxton Lynch, playing in place of the injured Trevor Siemian, punted on their first two possessions, and got on the scoreboard early in the second quarter, with a 35-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. Following an exchange of punts, a 33-yard field goal by Bryant just after the two-minute warning extended the Falcons' lead, in a drive that took seven minutes off the clock. In the third quarter, Lynch was intercepted by Falcons' safety Ricardo Allen at the Broncos' 42-yard line, and the Falcons capitalized, with quarterback Matt Ryan connecting on a 31-yard touchdown pass to running back Tevin Coleman to extend to a 20-3 lead. On the Falcons' next drive, Broncos' safety T. J. Ward forced a fumble off wide receiver Mohamed Sanu at midfield, though the Broncos had to settle for a 46-yard field goal by McManus early in the fourth quarter. The Falcons responded, with a 25-yard field goal by McManus to extend to a 23-6 lead with 8:24 remaining in the game. Hoping for a rally, the Broncos went on a 16-play, 78-yard drive, culminating in a 3-yard touchdown pass from Lynch to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas with 2:43 remaining. After an unsuccessful onside kick attempt, the Broncos' defense forced a three-and-out, but were forced to use all of their team timeouts prior to the two-minute warning. The Broncos advanced 44 yards in 7 plays, and pulled to within a 23-16 deficit, with a 45-yard field goal by McManus with only 19 seconds remaining. However, another onside kick attempt was unsuccessful, sealing the win for the Falcons. Demaryius Thomas became the third player in Broncos' franchise history to achieve 50 career touchdowns; the other two are Shannon Sharpe (55) and Rod Smith (68).",

The Panthers took an early lead in the first quarter when Olindo Mare kicked a 27-yard field goal, and made it 10-0 when Steve Smith caught a 15-yard touchdown pass. The Lions answered in the second quarter when Kevin Smith ran in a touchdown from 28 yards out. Carolina responded with 2 touchdowns. First, Kealoha Pilares returned a kickoff the entire length of the field for 7 points, then a few minutes later, QB Cam Newton ran it in himself for another 7. At this point, the Lions were down by 17 points with the score 24-7. The Lions' Titus Young then caught a 3-yard pass for a TD. The Panthers kicked a 31-yard field goal just before halftime, putting the Lions down by 13 points. After the break, the Lions mounted yet another second half comeback with 3 consecutive touchdowns. First, Nate Burleson caught a 6-yard pass, then Tony Scheffler caught a 17-yard pass, giving the Lions their first lead of the game. Then in the 4th quarter, Kevin Smith scored his second touchdown of the game, this one on a 4-yard rush. The Panthers scored their only points of the second half when Cam Newton recorded his second rushing touchdown; Carolina's Cam Newton then completed a 2-point conversion to Steve Smith to tie the game. A few minutes later, Detroit retook the lead when Brandon Pettigrew caught a 7-yard pass for a TD. The Lions capped their victory with Kevin Smith's third touchdown of the game, this one on a 19-yard rush. By winning this game after trailing by 17 points, the Lions are the first team in NFL history that have won 3 games in one season in which they trailed by at least 17 points.",

They scored touchdowns on three consecutive drives in the first half, including two Nicks receptions of 6 and 12 yards. This was Nicks' second consecutive 100-yard receiving game, and he was now among the top 10 receivers league-wide in receptions, receiving yards, receptions of 20+ yards, and receiving touchdowns for the season. Jacobs also contributed a 1-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. In the third quarter, former Giant Derrick Ward provided Houston with their first touchdown of the day, but the newly dominant Giants defense did not allow any further damage. Smith's 4-yard reception late in the fourth quarter sealed the victory for the Giants.",

        "passage": "Franz Claasen, a loyal slave of the van Stell family, was deeded the Mary Point Estate for alerting the family to the rebellion and assisting in their escape to St. Thomas. Franz Claasen's land deed was recorded August 20, 1738, by Jacob van Stell, making Claasen the first 'Free Colored' landowner on St. John. Denmark ended the African slave trade in the Danish West Indies on January 1, 1803, but slavery continued on the islands. When the British emancipated their slaves in the British West Indies in 1838, slaves on St. John began escaping to nearby Tortola and other British islands. On May 24, 1840, eleven slaves from St. John stole a boat and escaped to Tortola during the night. The eight men , and three women  were from the Annaberg plantation and ten Leinster Bay estates. Brother Schmitz, the local Moravian missionary, was sent to Tortola by the St. John police to persuade the slaves to return. After meeting with the Tortola officials and the runaway slaves, Schmitz returned to St. John to relay the slaves' resolve to stay away because of abusive treatment by the overseers on the plantations. After planters replaced those overseers, Charles Bryan, his wife Katurah, and James Jacobs returned to work at Leinster Bay. Kitty, Paulus, David, and Adam moved to St. Thomas. Henry Law, Petrus, and Polly stayed on Tortola. John Curry relocated to Trinidad. None of the runaway slaves were punished. Slaves and free blacks petitioned the colonial government and Denmark to abolish slavery. On July 3, 1848, 114 years after the slave insurrection, enslaved Afro-Caribbeans of St. Croix held a non-violent, mass demonstration seeking abolition of slavery. The Governor-General da:Peter von Scholten declared emancipation throughout the Danish West Indies.",

The Browns saw their three-game winning streak end as the Texans' defense and run game dominated the Browns in a 23-7 blowout loss. Texans DE J. J. Watt, who played tight end in high school, scored the 5th offensive TD of his career. The Browns' lone score came in the 2nd quarter.  A touchdown from Brian Hoyer to Browns' receiver Andrew Hawkins tied the game at 7 in the second quarter.  However, the Texans scored the final 16 points of the contest.  Hoyer struggled as he was 20/50 passing for 330 yards, throwing only one touchdown while throwing a 4th quarter interception.  It was only the second time this season that the Browns got shut out in the second half of a game, an event that also occurred in their 24-6 loss to the Jaguars.  With the loss, the Browns fell out of 1st place in the AFC North and into a tie for 3rd place behind the Bengals and Steelers, who both won that week. Defensive linemen John Hughes and Phil Taylor were lost for the season on IR, and Jordan Cameron missed his 3rd straight game due to a concussion. On November 18, the Browns released RB Ben Tate.",

        "passage": "Staying at home, the Texans (still searching for their first win of the year) played a Week 4 intraconference match-up against the Miami Dolphins.  After a scoreless first quarter, Houston trailed early, as Miami kicker Olindo Mare got a 52-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Texans would get a field goal of their own, with kicker Kris Brown getting a 32-yard field goal before halftime.  In the third quarter, Houston fell behind, as Mare kicked a 29-yard field goal for Miami.  In the fourth quarter, the Texans rallied against the Dolphins, as QB David Carr took the ball into the endzone from one yard out, then completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson later in the quarter.  Mario Williams recorded his first career sack and added a half sack one play later. Afterwards, Houston would have to hold off a late rally by Miami.  Mare kicked a 22-yard field goal, and later got a touchdown, as QB Daunte Culpepper threw a 16-yard strike to WR Chris Chambers. Fortunately, the Texans prevented a two-point conversion when Mario Williams tipped the pass and held on to pick up their first win of the year.",

In the second quarter, the Raiders continued to trail as kicker Matt Prater got a 26-yard field goal, while FB Michael Pittman got a 3-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Oakland got even more black and blue as Cutler completed a 48-yard TD pass to WR Darrell Jackson, while Prater nailed a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Raiders finally got on the board as QB JaMarcus Russell completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR Ashley Lelie.  Denver ended its rout with RB Selvin Young's 5-yard TD run and Pittman's 1-yard TD run.  Oakland would close the game with Russell's 4-yard TD pass to WR Ronald Curry. With the dismal loss, the Raiders began their season at 0-1 for the sixth straight year.",

        "passage": "The Cleveland Browns opened the regular season at home in Cleveland Browns Stadium against the Pittsburgh Steelers, who entered the game under the direction of the team's new head coach, Mike Tomlin. However, the Browns' ended the day with a 34-7 loss to the Steelers. A number of Browns errors gave Pittsburgh opportunities to take a first quarter lead. After being stopped on their first possession, the Browns were forced to punt. Paul Ernster fumbled the snap, which resulted in a poor kick, and the Browns were called for four penalties on the play. The Steelers took possession on the Browns' 22-yard line and scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Ben Ben Roethlisberger to Hines Ward. On the Browns' next possession, Charlie Frye threw an interception to Deshea Townsend, which eventually led to the Steelers' second score of the game, a 26-yard field goal by Jeff Reed. The Brown next possession ended when Jamal Lewis fumbled the ball at the Browns' 40-yard line. The Steelers quickly converted the turnover, with Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes on the next play to bring the score to 17-0. After being sacked five times and throwing for only 34&#160;yards on 4-of-10 passing, Frye was removed from the game and was replaced by second-string quarterback Derek Anderson. In the second quarter, Willie Parker fumbled the ball and gave the Browns possession. However, the team was forced to punt, and just two drives later, the Browns fumbled the ball again - this time on a sack by Ryan Clark of Anderson. The Browns were able to hold the Steelers scoreless through the second quarter as Roethlisberger failed to connect on his last six pass attempts of the quarter. However, the Steelers also held the Browns scoreless, and the teams entered halftime with the Steelers ahead 17-0. The second half began well for the Steelers, with an eight-play, 71-yard drive that ended in a 5-yard touchdown pass to rookie Matt Spaeth. The Browns countered with a long drive of 76&#160;yards that ended with a one-yard touchdown pass from Anderson to second-year fullback Lawrence Vickers, cutting the deficit to 24-7. However, this would be the Browns' only score of the game. On the next drive, the Steelers answered with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Heath Miller, giving the Steelers a 31-7 advantage. The Browns punted on their next possession, and the Steelers capped an eight-minute drive with a 31-yard field goal by Reed, giving the Steelers a 34-7 lead, which they never surrendered. On the Browns' next offensive possession, Braylon Edwards dropped a pass from Anderson, which was ruled a fumble. Following a Steelers punt, Anderson threw an interception to Ike Taylor on a pass intended for Edwards, and Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch ran the clock out, securing the win. The loss put the Browns record at 0-1, and allowed the Steelers to take a one-game lead in the overall series, 56 wins to 55. Following the game, head coach Romeo Crennel stated that he didn't know who would start at quarterback in the next game versus the Cincinnati Bengals. He also stood by his decision not to insert rookie Brady Quinn into the game, even after chants were heard from the home crowd hoping otherwise. On Tuesday, September 11, the Browns traded Frye, who was expected to start against the Bengals in week two, to the Seattle Seahawks for a sixth-round draft choice. The Browns are the first team since 1970 to trade their starting quarterback before Week 2. The team's general manager, Phil Savage, stated that Anderson was to be named the team's new starting quarterback, with Quinn moving up the depth chart to be Anderson's backup. The Browns also re-signed Ken Dorsey, whom the team had cut just ten days earlier, to be the team's third-string quarterback and mentor to Quinn.",

        "passage": "The final home game of the year featured the Bears hosting the Washington Redskins, who led the all-time series 26-23-1. To attack Washington's defense, Jeff Joniak stated the Bears should utilize Jordan Howard; Howard, who was approaching 1,200 rushing yards on the season, took on a Redskins run defense that ranked 27th in percentage of runs at least four yards and 30th in first down run defense with 4.98 yards per carry. As for Chicago's defense, it faced a Washington offense that ranked third in the league. It also contained plenty of speed with players like receivers DeSean Jackson, who recorded three 100-yard games in the last four; Jamison Crowder, who led the Redskins with seven receiving touchdowns; Pierre Gar&#231;on, who led the team with 71 catches; tight ends Jordan Reed and Vernon Davis combined for 104 catches and seven touchdowns. Joniak added the run defense, who struggled against the Packers last week, needed to watch running back Rob Kelly, who ran for 137 yards against Green Bay five weeks earlier. Joniak also wrote the Bears had provided a challenge for playoff-contending teams, and one like the Redskins, who were \"on a short week, off a loss and on the road,\" was \"susceptible against the feisty Bears.\" Chris Thompson scored the first points of the game for the Redskins with a seven-yard touchdown run. Matt Barkley attempted to lead the Bears in response, spurred by 18-yard passes to Deonte Thompson and Alshon Jeffery along with Howard's 23-yard run. However, Barkley threw two incomplete passes, which resulted in Connor Barth attempting a 22-yard field goal, but the kick was blocked by Preston Smith. Thompson ran for a 17-yard touchdown on the next drive; when Chicago entered Washington territory once again, Barkley's pass for Josh Bellamy went into triple coverage and was intercepted by Bashaud Breeland at the one-yard line. Dustin Hopkins later kicked a 29-yard field goal. The next three drives of the game ended with a touchdown: Jeremy Langford ran for a one-yard touchdown, Kirk Cousins recorded a nine-yard touchdown run and Barkley threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Meredith. Barkley struggled early in the second half when he threw interceptions on each of the Bears' first four drives of the half to Josh Norman (twice), Breeland and Will Blackmon; the Redskins converted two of the picks into scores with Cousins' one-yard touchdown run and Hopkins' 20-yard field goal. Although Barkley threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Thompson, Mack Brown's 61-yard touchdown run increased the margin between the two teams to 20 points as the Bears lost 41-21. With the loss, the Bears fell to 3-12 for the first time since the NFL expanded to 16 games in 1978. The 41 points allowed were the most since the team allowed 48 in 2015 to the Cardinals.",

Before the game, a pregame ceremony was held for the late Walter Payton, who died exactly 10 years ago on November 1. Chicago got off to a fast start in the first quarter as kicker Robbie Gould made a 37-yard and a 29-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Bears would add onto their lead as Gould booted a 32-yard field goal, followed by running back Matt Fort&#233; got a 1-yard touchdown run.  In the third quarter, the Browns would get onto their board with a 1-yard touchdown run by quarterback Derek Anderson (with a blocked PAT).  Afterwards, Chicago would continue their dominating day with a 10-yard touchdown run by Fort&#233;.  The Bears would then close out the game in the fourth quarter with cornerback Charles Tillman returning an interception 21 yards for a touchdown.",

The Cardinals strained the Vikings' defense, but the offense, headed by Matt Cassel in the first half, was able to keep pace with their scoring to see the Vikings trailing 14-13 at halftime. The Vikings switched to Teddy Bridgewater after the half, and the rookie quarterback orchestrated a pair of drives that put the Vikings back in the lead 24-21. A few drives later, the Vikings' defense would end up being penalized three straight times, allowing the Cardinals to score a touchdown through a botched snap that was recovered by the Cardinals and run into the end zone. The Vikings were given the ball with around a minute to score. Bridgewater led the Vikings down field in comeback fashion to score the game-winner with a pass to Rodney Smith, sealing another preseason victory for the Vikings.",

Rookie phenom Adrian Peterson and quarterback Kelly Holcomb, who spent the offseason on the Eagles' roster, took the Vikings down the field for the game's first score - a nine-yard touchdown pass to Visanthe Shiancoe. A 50-yard reception by Greg Lewis down the field set up David Akers' first field goal, then Donovan McNabb guided the Eagles to a touchdown drive early in the second quarter, with Brian Westbrook the recipient of a short six-yard scoring pass. Westbrook carried it up the middle from the one-yard line on Philadelphia's next drive to make it 17-7. Ryan Longwell booted a 39-yard field goal for Minnesota to draw the score to 17-10 later in the second quarter. Akers and Longwell traded field goals in the third quarter to make it 20-13. A 48-yarder by Longwell in the final quarter drew the Vikings to within four points, but they would get no closer, while Akers added his third field goal to restore the seven-point lead. McNabb's 333 passing yards were his most since the Detroit game, while Reggie Brown topped 100 yards for the first time all season. Westbrook had 92 all-purpose yards and a touchdown on the ground and in the air. Trent Cole recorded two sacks.",

Jabal Shammar was annexed in 1920-21, while Kuwait was defeated in 1922, defining the border with Iraq and Transjordan through the Uqair protocol of 1922, while simultaneously conquering Asir in south Arabia. By early 1923, Ibn Saud decided to take over Hejaz, but was unsure over British position. The worsening relations between England and Hashemite rulers and the proclamation of Sharif Husayn as Caliph, finally made Ibn Saud to undertake the campaign, entusiasthically supported by the religiously insigted Ikhwan, who had hoped to take over the holy sites of Islam. The preliminary attack on Taif came in September 1924, beginning the Saudi conquest, which would be complete on December 1925.",

        "passage": "The Colts rallied from a 14-point deficit in the second half to knock off the Browns, 25-24.  The defense got off to a fast start right away and dominated for 59 minutes, forcing 4 turnovers in the contest. QB Andrew Luck fumbled on the Colts' 1 yard line, and the ball was recovered in the endzone to make it 7-0.  With a chance to go up 10-0, Browns K Billy Cundiff missed a 40 yd. field goal that would later prove to be very costly.  Following the miss, Luck rushed for a TD to tie the game at 7-7.  On the next drive, Hoyer led the Browns downfield; Rookie RB Isaiah Crowell ran in for a touchdown to lead 14-7 at halftime. In the second half, the Colts' turnover problems continued, committing a fumble on their first drive that the Browns couldn't convert into points. Later in the quarter, Luck threw a \"pick-six\" to Browns rookie DB Justin Gilbert (his 1st INT of the year), and the Browns went up 21-7.  The next two Colts' drives resulted in points (a field goal and a T. Y. Hilton touchdown), cutting the deficit to 21-16 heading into the 4th quarter. Adding another FG in the 4th to make it 21-19, and with a chance to take the lead, Luck threw another interception (he was sacked 3 times). However, the Browns failed to get a first down and were forced to settle for 3, making it 24-19 Browns and leaving the door open for the Colts to take the lead. With less than 4 minutes to go, Luck led a 90-yard game-winning touchdown drive. The Browns had a chance to end the game with a stop on 4th and inches at the 3 yard line, but RB Dan Herron avoided the tackle and picked up 2 yards for a Colts first down. Luck would throw the game-winning TD pass to Hilton on the next play, making it 25-24 Colts with 36 seconds left. After a failed two point conversion, and with the Browns having one more chance to win the game, Hoyer threw his 2nd INT with less than 10 seconds remaining, and the Colts ran out the clock. The Browns' offense was barely noticeable throughout the contest. TE Jordan Cameron returned to duty after 5 weeks, leading all Browns receivers with only 41 yds. 17 of the teams' 24 points came off of Colts turnovers, the defense converting two into TD's.  Punt and kick coverage teams kept returning fan-favorite KR Joshua Cribbs in check, and traded RB Trent Richardson was held to 30 yds. on 7 carries. MLB D'Qwell Jackson had 9 tackles for Indy, but no sacks. In the second half, the Browns' offense failed to convert a single 3rd down (0/6).  For the fourth consecutive game, Hoyer was dismal, passing 14/31 for 140 yards, 0 TD's, and 2 INT's (the third straight game that Hoyer had 0 TD's and multiple INT's).  It was the second game in a row that the Browns failed to win after holding a halftime lead.  It was only the second time that the Browns lost when holding a 4th quarter lead at any point (the other loss coming to the Ravens in Week 3). After starting 6-3, the Browns are 1-3 in their last 4 games.  The Browns' offense scored 26 points in their one victory while all 3 losses featured the offense scoring 10 or fewer points. The Browns fell to 7-6 on the season; wins by the Steelers and Ravens would leave the Browns in sole possession of 4th place in the AFC North.  It was the first time this season that the Browns lost back-to-back games, and consecutive home games. The Browns also lost their ninth consecutive December game, a drought that goes back to Week 15 of the 2012 season.  A loss in Week 15 to the Bengals (8-4-1) would eliminate the Browns (7-6) from contention for the AFC North title and possibly the postseason. On Tuesday, it was announced that Johnny Manziel would start over the struggling Brian Hoyer. Starting G Ryan Seymour moved to center, replacing Nick McDonald as the team's 4th center to start a game. He is expected to finish the season at that position. K Billy Cundiff was released from the team on December 13, replaced by K Garrett Hartley.",

        "passage": "In week 4, the Bears played against the Dallas Cowboys on Monday Night Football in Dallas. After a scoreless first quarter and Robbie Gould's field goal, Charles Tillman intercepted Tony Romo, returning the pick for a touchdown. The interception would be the first of Romo's five interceptions. Romo would later hit Miles Austin for a 10-yard touchdown. In the second half, Cutler was able to hit Devin Hester on a 34-yard touchdown pass to extend the Bears lead. Later, Romo's pass was intercepted by Bears linebacker Lance Briggs, who then returned the interception for a touchdown to increase the lead 24-7. The pick-six marked Bears' fourteenth forced turnover, which led the league, and also leads the league in interceptions (11). Cutler would then throw another touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. Cutler would have his highest performance of the season, completing 18 of 24 passes for 275 yards, along with two touchdowns. His 140.1 passer rating was the third highest of his career. Marshall caught seven passes for 138 yards, a season-best. With 34 seconds left in the game, Romo was replaced by former Bears quarterback Kyle Orton, who threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten, and the Cowboys had a two-point conversion, but the Bears would then win 34-18. With the win, the Bears shared the NFC North lead with the Minnesota Vikings with a 3-1 record.",

Neither team's designated starting quarterback would start the game as Josh McCown had a rib injury and Stelers' QB Ben Roethlisberger had an foot injury.  Pittsbugh QB Landry Jones would leave the game in the first quarter, forcing Roethlisberger into the game. Leading 6-3 after the 1st quarter, the Steelers would take control of the game in the 2nd quarter, scoring two touchdowns and taking a 21-3 lead into halftime.  Steelers K Chris Boswell added a field goal in the third quarter, followed up by a Johnny Manziel touchdown pass to Gary Barnidge early in the 4th quarter to cut the Pittsburgh lead to 24-9, but a late Steelers touchdown gave them a 30-9 lead, which would end up being the final. Coming off the bench, Roethlisberger passed for 379 yards and three touchdowns, two of which went to WR Antonio Brown who led the Steelers with 139 yards.  In the loss, Manziel passed for a career-high 372 yards with a touchdown, but he threw a key interception in the red zone.  The Steelers defense sacked Manziel six times. With the loss, the Browns entered their bye week at 2-8 and had sole possession of the NFL's worst record.",

In the second quarter, the Steelers moved up 14-0 when Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown. The Ravens got on the board when Joe Flacco found Chris Moore on a 30-yard pass to make it 14-7. The Steelers then moved ahead by double digits again when Chris Boswell put up a 52-yard field goal to make it 17-7. The Ravens then came within 3 when Alex Collins ran for an 18-yard touchdown to make the score 17-14. The Steelers closed out the half with another field goal kicked by Boswell from 43 yards out to make it 20-14 at halftime. In the third quarter, it was all Ravens when they took the lead after scoring 3 times: First when Justin Tucker managed to nail a 47-yard field goal to make it 20-17. This would be followed by Javorious Allen's 1-yard touchdown run as they took the lead 24-20. Flacco then found Patrick Ricard on a 6-yard pass as the Ravens moved up by double digits 31-20. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers managed to come within 2, starting with a 24-yard field goal kicked by Boswell shortening the Ravens' lead to 31-23. This would then be followed up by Roethlisberger connecting with Roosevelt Nix on a 1-yard pass (with a failed 2-point conversion) to make it 31-29. The Ravens managed to pull away when Allen ran for a 9-yard touchdown to make it 38-29. The Steelers then completed the comeback when Bell ran for an 11-yard touchdown to make it 38-36. This would be followed by Boswell kicking a 46-yard field goal to make it 39-38. The Ravens then got the ball back, but Flacco was sacked by T. J. Watt as time expired, sealing the win for the Steelers. With the win, the Steelers improved to 11-2 and were awarded the AFC North division title. The team also managed to win their 9th straight game over a divisional opponent. Pittsburgh notched their first 3-game win streak over the Ravens since defeating them three times during the 2008 season (including the playoffs). The teams' 77 combined points marked the most in series history. The team also swept the Ravens for the first time since 2008.  With the division clinched, the team would win consecutive titles for the first time since the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The Steelers' second consecutive 11+ point comeback victory marked the first time the Steelers had accomplished this feat since coming back from down 14 against the Denver Broncos on December 7, 1997 and then again from down 14 against the New England Patriots on December 13, 1997.",

Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The clubs kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998. Real Madrids first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982\u201383, 1983\u201384 and 1984\u201385 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992. In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the clubs website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens AG and in 2006, the BenQ logo appeared on the clubs shirt. Real Madrids shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens. Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed their sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth \u20ac70 million per year. In 2015, Madrid signed a new 10-year contract with Adidas believed to be worth a total of \u00a3850 million (\u20ac1 billion), earning \u00a359 million (\u20ac64 million) per season.",

In the second quarter, Pittsburgh answered with Moore getting another 1-yard TD run, along with kicker Jeff Reed getting a 42-yard field goal.  Indianapolis closed out the half with Manning completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark. In the third quarter, the Colts tied the game with kicker Adam Vinatieri getting a 36-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Steelers regained the lead as Reed nailed a 24-yard field goal.  Indianapolis took the lead as Manning completing a 17-yard TD pass to RB Dominic Rhodes, along with the defense preventing any Pittsburgh comeback. This was the Colts' first win in Pittsburgh since 1968. With the win, the Colts improved to 5-4.",

        "passage": "On 7 December 1543, the Confederation land and naval forces left Ava to start the invasion. The invaders easily overran Toungoo defenses en route to Prome, gaining complete control around Prome by late December. They launched several attacks on the city but could not take the city. By then, the Toungoo command had determined that Ava would probably not open a second front. They moved most of their troops from the Toungoo theater, and massed all their land and naval forces at Tharrawaddy , about 160\u00a0km south of Prome. In response, Hkonmaing lifted the siege, moved his army and navy to 3.2\u00a0km north of the city, and fortified their positions. The Toungoo navy led the counterattack. The larger and better equipped Toungoo war boats defeated smaller, less equipped Ava war boats. The surviving Ava war boats fled upriver, and were not heard from again. The Toungoo navy then sent 4000 troops who bypassed Prome and went on to occupy Thayet and Myede, about 60\u00a0km north of Prome, and successfully cut off from the Ava supply lines. Ava armies in the north tried to regain the strategic towns but were driven back each time. About a month later, c. late January/earlyFebruary 1544, the Confederation command decided to retreat. The retreating Confederation forces had to fight off the Toungoo armies led by Bayinnaung. They split into four smaller armies, and made their way to Salin, about 200\u00a0km north of Myede.",

Average temperature in the peninsula varies from 24\u00a0\u00b0C  in January to 29\u00a0\u00b0C  in July. The lowest temperature on record is 6\u00a0\u00b0C . For the peninsula as a whole, the mean annual precipitation is 1,100 millimetres . The rainy season lasts from June to September, while the dry season runs from October to May. During the dry season, rainfall averages 300 millimetres ; in the wet season this increases to an average 800 to 900 millimetres . The prevailing winds are easterly and have created an east-west precipitation gradient with average rainfall in the east exceeding 1,400 millimetres  and the north and northwestern portions of the peninsula receiving a maximum of 800 millimetres . The southeastern portion of the peninsula has a tropical rainy climate with a short dry season in winter. Pet\u00e9n has a hot climate and receives the highest rainfall in all Mesoamerica. The climate is divided into wet and dry seasons, with the rainy season lasting from June to December, although these seasons are not clearly defined in the south;  with rain occurring through most of the year. The climate of Pet\u00e9n varies from tropical in the south to semitropical in the north; temperature varies between 12 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C , although it does not usually drop beneath 18\u00a0\u00b0C .

        "passage": "Still on the hunt for their first win of the season, the Rams flew to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium for a Week 6 interconference duel with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  St. Louis got the opening charge in the first quarter with quarterback Marc Bulger's 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donnie Avery.  The Jaguars would answer with running back Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 4-yard touchdown run (with a failed PAT).  Afterwards, the Rams would get the only points of the second quarter as kicker Josh Brown nailed a 52-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, a back-and-forth quarter would ensue. Jones-Drew would help Jacksonville take the lead with a 1-yard touchdown run, yet Rams defensive end Leonard Little would return an interception 36 yards for a touchdown. Following a 3-yard touchdown run by Jones-Drew, St. Louis would tie the game with Brown's 27-yard field goal.  However, in overtime, the Jaguars got the last laugh as kicker Josh Scobee booted the game-winning 36-yard field goal.",

Philadelphia entered the game with five starters out due to injury, including running back Brian Westbrook. Penalties, sacks, and the absence of Westbrook stymied the offense, which scored 56 points last week, throughout the first three quarters. The Giants took the lead on a touchdown reception by Plaxico Burress in the second quarter. A botched handoff led to a defensive touchdown for Kawika Mitchell and a 16-0 New York lead. David Akers' 53-yard field goal in the fourth quarter allowed the Eagles to avoid a shutout. Osi Umenyiora had six of the Giants' sacks. Correll Buckhalter rushed for 103 yards in the defeat. The loss drops Philadelphia to 1-3, their worst start since 1999, as they entered their bye week.",

An 80-yard TD by Jordy Nelson in the third quarter gave the Packers a lead they wouldn't relinquish. Late in the 4th quarter, the Jets had one last chance to tie the game. On 4th down, Jets quarterback Geno Smith seemed to have thrown a game-tying touchdown pass, but an official announced that the Jets had called for a timeout just before the ball was snapped. A confused Jets head coach, Rex Ryan, argued with the officials that he didn't call for a timeout. A look at the video replay showed that Jets offensive coordinator, Mary Mornhinwig, started running to Ryan, calling for a timeout. Even though the rules said that only the head coach could call for a timeout in that situation, the official simply heard a voice shouting for a timeout, and unable to look back to see who it was, since it was just before the ball was snapped, the official assumed that Ryan called for the timeout. While the Jets were able to convert the 4th down after the timeout, they were unable to move the ball any further, and turned the ball over on downs, at which point the Packers ran out the final 3:31 of the clock to get their first victory of the season.",

        "passage": "Under continuing pressure from the PRC to bar any representation of the ROC that may imply statehood, international organizations have adopted different policies toward the issue of ROC's participation. In cases where almost all UN members or sovereign states participate, such as the World Health Organization, the ROC has been completely shut out, while in others, such as the World Trade Organization  and International Olympic Committee  the ROC participates under unusual names: \"Chinese Taipei\" in the case of APEC and the IOC, and the \"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kimmen and Matsu\"  in the case of the WTO. The issue of ROC's name came under scrutiny during the 2006 World Baseball Classic. The organizers of the 16-team tournament intended to call Taiwan as such, but reverted to \"Chinese Taipei\" under pressure from PRC. The ROC protested the decision, claiming that the WBC is not an IOC event, but did not prevail. The ISO 3166 directory of names of countries and territories registers Taiwan  separately from and in addition to the People's Republic of China , but lists Taiwan as \"Taiwan, Province of China\" based on the name used by the UN under PRC pressure. In ISO 3166-2:CN, Taiwan is also coded CN-71 under China, thus making Taiwan part of China in ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2 categories. Naming issues surrounding Taiwan/ROC continue to be a contentious issue in non-governmental organizations such as the Lions Club, which faced considerable controversy naming its Taiwanese branch.",

In the skirmish that followed, Captain Cosgaya, five of his soldiers and eight Indians were killed. Canek told his followers that the ultimate victory of the Mayas was already written in Chilam Balam manuscripts. The governor of Yucat\u00e1n sent dispatches calling up militias, and ordering Indians throughout the province to be disarmed. A major force under the command of Estanislao del Puerto and Crist\u00f3bal Calder\u00f3n was sent out to surround the village to prevent reinforcements for Canek and his followers. The rebels were meanwhile preparing their defenses and attempting to expand the rebellion to nearby villages. The Spanish force of 500 soldiers met Canek and his cohorts on November 26, 1761 in the plaza of Cisteil, where 1500 Maya were arrayed in two entrenched lines. In hand-to-hand fighting, the better-armed Spanish triumphed. The village was burned, and 500 Indians were said to have perished in the blaze, including eight priests or leaders of the rebellion. Canek himself escaped with a small guard, fleeing to Huntulchac. There he assembled a force of about 300 men who had also escaped from Cisteil. But Canek and about 125 followers were then apprehended at Sibac. Canek was condemned to death, to be \"tortured, his body broken, and thereafter burned and the ashes scattered to the wind.\"",

        "passage": "In week three, the Bears went to Arlington, Texas to face the Dallas Cowboys in the second game of 2016 against a Texas-based team; this marked the first time since 1992 that the Bears played on the road against both Texas teams in a season. Week three marked the 26th game between Chicago and Dallas, the latter leading the series 14-11 entering the game. While the Bears won the last game in Dallas 34-18 (in 2012), the Cowboys won the most recent game 41-28 (in 2014). Jeff Joniak wrote the Bears offense should attack the Cowboys with their run game; the latter had allowed 4.8 yards per carry in the first two games. Additionally, the offense was without Jay Cutler after his injury sustained in week two, meaning Brian Hoyer started against Dallas, though Alshon Jeffery, who was battling knee injuries during the week, made his return for week three. The defense, also depleted by injuries with players like Danny Trevathan and Eddie Goldman ruled out for the game, had to be able to successfully tackle Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant and tight end Jason Witten while also applying pressure on rookie quarterback Dak Prescott. Joniak also wrote the Bears needed to excel on both sides in the red zone; against the Eagles, the Bears defense had a 50 percent touchdown efficiency in the red zone, made some big plays in the red zone in the loss to the Eagles, with a 50 percent touchdown efficiency rating on six attempts. Meanwhile, against the Washington Redskins, the Cowboys restricted them to just two field goals in the red zone, including a late interception by Barry Church. The Bears fell behind early when Prescott scored on a quarterback sneak during the opening drive. The Bears' next two drives ended with punts, while the Cowboys' resulting drives concluded with scores: Dan Bailey kicked a 49-yard field goal and Lance Dunbar scored on a one-yard run. Down 17-0, Chicago would score their first points of the game via Connor Barth's 34-yard field goal in the second quarter. On the following kickoff, Barth attempted an onside kick that Sherrick McManis successfully recovered, but Jonathan Anderson was ruled offsides, nullifying the play. Instead of retrying the onside, Barth simply kicked off. Dallas scored on the next drive with Alfred Morris' three-yard touchdown run. After the Bears punted to start the second half, they regained possession when Terrance Williams was stripped by Jacoby Glenn and Adrian Amos recovered the ball. The takeaway resulted in the first touchdown of the game for the Bears when Hoyer threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller. Though the Cowboys punted on their next drive, Cameron Meredith was stripped by J. J. Wilcox and Tyrone Crawford recovered the fumble. However, they were unable to score when Bailey missed a 47-yard field goal wide left. In the fourth quarter, the Cowboys extended the lead when Bryant scored on a 17-yard touchdown catch. Hoyer responded when he threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Miller to make the score 31-14, but he lost a fumble when he was strip-sacked by Benson Mayowa on the Bears' next series, while the offense was unable to score on their final possession.",

Anderson helped Arizona take the lead late in the third quarter with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Larry Fitzgerald. Arizona led 24-20 at the end of the third quarter. Sebastian Janikowski made the lead 24-23 with another field goal in the fourth quarter. Arizona held on for the win after Janikowski missed a 32-yard field goal as time expired.

        "passage": "Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Rams, the Broncos returned home for an AFC duel against the Miami Dolphins &#8212; the Broncos' first home game in exactly one month. The Dolphins grabbed the early lead, with running back Daniel Thomas rushing for a 3-yard touchdown. The Broncos subsequently got on the scoreboard, with a 38-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. The Dolphins added to their lead early in the second quarter, with quarterback Ryan Tannehill rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. The Broncos cut into the Dolphins' lead, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, however, the Dolphins responded, with Tannehill throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace. Another touchdown pass from Manning to Demaryius Thomas &#8212; from 14 yards out &#8212; narrowed the Dolphins' lead to 21-17 just before halftime. The Broncos drove to as far as the Dolphins' 7-yard line on the initial possession of the second half, but after Manning was sacked by Dolphins' linebacker Jelani Jenkins for an 8-yard loss, McManus missed on a 33-yard field goal attempt. After the Broncos' defense forced a Dolphins' punt, return specialist Isaiah Burse fumbled deep in Broncos' territory, giving the football back to the Dolphins. Four plays later, Tannehill connected with wide receiver Jarvis Landry on a 5-yard touchdown pass to give the Dolphins a 28-17 lead at the 2:15 mark of the third quarter. The Broncos then reeled off 22 unanswered points. Early in the fourth quarter, Manning threw his third touchdown pass of the game to Demaryius Thomas &#8212; from 5 yards out &#8212; coupled with a two-point conversion pass to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders. After forcing a Dolphins' punt, the Broncos grabbed their first lead of the game at the 5:05 mark of the fourth quarter, with running back C. J. Anderson rushing for a 10-yard touchdown. On the third play of the Dolphins' next possession, Tannehill was intercepted by Broncos' safety T. J. Ward, who advanced the football all the way to the Dolphins' 8-yard line. Two plays later, Manning threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker to increase the Broncos' lead to 39-28 with 3:17 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Dolphins attempted a rally, with Tannehill connecting on a 1-yard touchdown pass to Landry, coupled with running back Lamar Miller rushing for a two-point conversion, with 1:37 remaining in the game. However, the Dolphins' onside kick attempt was unsuccessful, and the Broncos subsequently ran out the clock. Demaryius Thomas' streak of 100-yard receiving games ended at seven games, one shy of the NFL record that was set by Detroit Lions' wide receiver Calvin Johnson in 2012.",

        "passage": "The Patriots stay at home for a matchup against the Tyrod Taylor-led Bills. On the first play of scrimmage, Brissett hit Edelman on a 90-yard catch-and-run to the Bills 1, but the play was nullified by a holding penalty on former Buffalo Bills player, Chris Hogan. The Patriots didn't get a first down and punted. Starting from their own 35, the Bills marched 65 yards in over 7 minutes, scoring on a 7-yard touchdown pass from Taylor to LeSean McCoy. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Bills marched to the Patriots 16, but settled for Dan Carpenter's 34-yard field goal on the second play of the second quarter, making the score 10-0. After forcing the Patriots to punt, the Bills drove 71 yards and Carpenter ended the drive with a 43-yard field goal, extending the lead to 13-0. The Patriots drove all the way to the Bills 18 on their ensuing possession, but Brissett was strip-sacked by Zach Brown with Preston Brown recovering for the Bills. Starting at their own 9, the Bills drove to their own 42, but punted. The Patriots punted as well, and the Bills led 13-0 at halftime. After forcing the Bills to punt on the opening drive, the Patriots drove to the Bills 30, but Gostkowski missed a 48-yard field goal. The Bills countered, reaching the Patriots 29, but then Carpenter missed a 47-yard field goal. After yet another Patriots punt, Ben Tate returned the punt 18 yards to the Bills 30. The Bills reached the Patriots 26, and Carpenter nailed a 44-yard field goal stretching the score to 16-0. Midway through the fourth quarter, the Patriots drove all the way to the Bills 21, but turned the ball over on downs. After a Bills punt, the Patriots reached the Bills 44, but the clock ran out. With the loss the Patriots fell to 3-1. This was the first shutout for the Patriots at home since 1993, as well as their first shutout loss since 2006. This was also the team's first shut out loss to the Bills since 2003.",

        "passage": "Coming off their Thanksgiving win over their divisional foe, the Lions, the Packers flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 13 Thursday night intraconference duel with the throwback-clad Dallas Cowboys. This match-up would see two 10-1 teams face one another for the first time since 1990 when the New York Giants lost to the San Francisco 49ers. Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo faced off against his boyhood idol Brett Favre in the game. The Packers started the game missing two key players of their defense, with injured cornerback Charles Woodson (tied for 7th in the NFL with 4 interceptions) and pass-rushing end Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila (tied for 6th in the NFL with 9.5 sacks) on the inactive list. In the first quarter, Green Bay took the early lead as rookie kicker Mason Crosby completed a 47-yard field goal. On the first play of the Cowboys opening drive, Al Harris stripped the ball from Terrell Owens and side judge Laird Hayes signaled Green Bay ball, but head linesman Derick Bowers overruled him. The only option for Mike McCarthy to challenge on the play, since the whistle was blown, was whether it was a reception - the strip could not be reviewed. The replay upheld the reception and Dallas retained possession.  Nick Folk completed a 26-yard field goal to tie the game. Folk also completed a 51-yard field goal, and QB Tony Romo threw a 3-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton. The Packers would end the first quarter with rookie RB Ryan Grant running for a 62-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Dallas responded with Romo completing a 26-yard TD pass to TE Anthony Fasano and a 10-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Brett Favre left the game in the second quarter after he hit his right elbow on the helmet of a blitzing Cowboys DB Nate Jones. The throw led to Favre's second interception. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers took over for the Packers next series and led the offense on a 74-yard drive, capping it off with an 11-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings. In the third, Grant finished off a 69-yard Packer drive with a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the quarter. In the fourth quarter, Romo completed a 4-yard TD pass to Crayton. Mason Crosby kicked a 52-yard field goal with just over 5&#160;minutes remaining in the game to pull the Packers within a field goal. Dallas sealed the win as Folk kicked a 25-yard field goal with 1:03 left in the game. The Packers were flagged for a season-high 142 penalty yards.",

In the first quarter, Gostkowski kicked a 35-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, New England continued to build on their lead, as Gostkowski kicked a 31-yard field goal, while Brady completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to Troy Brown.  The Dolphins responded with a two-yard touchdown run by running back Ronnie Brown and a 40-yard field goal by Olindo Mare as the first half came to a close.  After a scoreless third quarter, the Patriots secured their victory with the only points of the second half, a one-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Faulk. With the win, the Patriots advanced 4-1.",

        "passage": "M\u00e1laga, the chief seaport of Granada, was the main objective of the Castilian forces in 1487. Emir al-Zagal was slow to march to attempt to relieve the siege and was unable to harass the Christian armies safely because of the ongoing civil war; even after he left the city to come to the aid of M\u00e1laga, he was forced to leave troops in the Alhambra to defend against Boabdil and his followers. The first main city to be attacked, V\u00e9lez-M\u00e1laga, capitulated on 27 April 1487, with local supporters of Boabdil directly aiding the Christian besiegers.  M\u00e1laga held out during an extended siege that lasted from 7 May 1487 until 18 August 1487; its commander preferred death to surrender, and the African garrison and Christian renegades  fought tenaciously, fearing the consequences of defeat.  Near the end, the notables of M\u00e1laga finally offered a surrender, but Ferdindad refused, as generous terms had already been offered twice.  When the city finally fell, Ferdinand punished almost all the inhabitants for their stubborn resistance with slavery, while renegades were burned alive or pierced by reeds. The Jews of Malaga, however, were spared, as Castilian Jews ransomed them from slavery. Historian William Prescott considered the fall of M\u00e1laga the most important part of the war; as the chief port of Granada, Granada could not reasonably continue on as an independent state without it.",

        "passage": "Facing a desperate season verging on the point of disaster yet again, the Browns traveled again in Week 10 to the Georgia Dome in Atlanta to meet the Atlanta Falcons. The 5-3 Falcons were determined to rebound from their disappointed Week 9 loss to the Detroit Lions. In the first quarter, nothing happened until very late. With 3:33 remaining in the quarter, Browns quarterback Charlie Frye connected on a 40-yard pass to tight end Kellen Winslow. That put the Browns on the Atlanta 6-yard line and 3 plays later, on 4th and 1, the Browns scored on a run by running back Reuben Droughns and the Browns took a 7-0 lead. The second quarter started with a bang for the Browns. Atlanta had 2nd and 9 on the Cleveland 49 when Falcons quarterback Michael Vick threw an interception to Browns safety Sean Jones. The Browns drove the ball quickly down the field and, with 11:59 remaining in the quarter, Charlie Frye connected with tight end Braylon Edwards on a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Browns lead was 14-0. At the two-minute-warning, Reuben Droughns fumbled on the Atlanta 35. The Falcons attempted a two-minute-drill offense, but the Browns stood Vick up at the Browns 26. However, Falcons kicker Morten Andersen kicked a 44-yard field goal to get on the board 14-3 at halftime Very little happened in the third quarter. Michael Vick was driving in Cleveland territory with 5:28 remaining when he was intercepted again by Browns safety Brodney Pool. However, the ensuing Browns possession resulted in a Dave Zastudil punt. The punt was out of their own endzone and was returned to the Browns 12. It took two plays for Vick to connect with wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a touchdown. The score was then 14-10. The possibility of success seemed unlikely for the Browns in the fourth quarter. After the teams each went three and out, Atlanta gained favorable field position and were able to bring Andersen in for a 46-yard field goal.  At that point the Browns were leading 14-13. The next drive for the Browns looked promising. After two passes to tight end Steve Heiden and a 36-yard pass to Kellen Winslow, the Browns then faltered and had to settle for a 43-yard Phil Dawson field goal. The score was 17-13. With 3:18 remaining in the game, Atlanta took over on their own 28-yard line. Down by 4, Vick let in loose downfield to an open receiver Roddy White for a 55-yard gain. The Falcons then committed a 10-yard penalty and Vick threw an incomplete pass. With 2nd and 20 on the Cleveland 27, Vick fumbled the ball on 3rd down to a waiting Browns rookie cornerback Jereme Perry. Out of timeouts, the Falcons fell for a second week in a row to the Browns.",

        "passage": "In week 14, the Lions flew across Lake Michigan for a rematch with NFC North Division rivals the Green Bay Packers on Sunday Night Football. The only scoring drive of the first quarter was when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford ran in a touchdown himself from 4 yards out. The Lions added more points in the second quarter when Tony Scheffler caught a Matthew Stafford pass from 3 yards out. The Packers got on the board when Mason Crosby kicked a 49-yard field goal, and added more points when Mike Daniels picked up a Matthew Stafford fumble and ran it back 43 yards for a touchdown to make it 14-10 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Packers took their first lead of the game when quarterback Aaron Rodgers ran in a touchdown from 27 yards, but the Lions tied it up a few minutes later when Jason Hanson kicked a 46-yard field goal. In the final quarter, the Packers took the lead back when DuJuan Harris ran in a touchdown from 14 yards out, and went up by 10 points when Mason Crosby kicked a 41-yard field goal. The Lions' Jason Hanson kicked a 34-yard field goal in the final seconds of the game, and the Lions attempted to recover an onside kick afterward to try to tie it up and take it to overtime, but failed. It was the Packers' 21st consecutive home win over the Lions, a streak that dates back to 1992, and now eclipses the Lions' current road losing streak vs the Washington Redskins, which stands at 0-21.",

        "passage": "Although multinational corporations dominate Ireland's export sector, exports from other sources also contribute significantly to the national income. The activities of multinational companies based in Ireland have made it one of the largest exporters of pharmaceutical agents, medical devices and software-related goods and services in the world. Ireland's exports also relate to the activities of large Irish companies  and exports of mineral resources: Ireland is the seventh largest producer of zinc concentrates, and the twelfth largest producer of lead concentrates. The country also has significant deposits of gypsum, limestone, and smaller quantities of copper, silver, gold, barite, and dolomite. Tourism in Ireland contributes about 4% of GDP and is a significant source of employment. Other goods exports include agri-food, cattle, beef, dairy products, and aluminum. Ireland's major imports include data processing equipment, chemicals, petroleum and petroleum products, textiles, and clothing. Financial services provided by multinational corporations based at the Irish Financial Services Centre also contribute to Irish exports. The difference between exports  and imports  resulted an annual trade surplus of \u20ac43.9 billion in 2010, which is the highest trade surplus relative to GDP achieved by any EU member state. The EU is by far the country's largest trading partner, accounting for 57.9% of exports and 60.7% of imports. The United Kingdom is the most important trading partner within the EU, accounting for 15.4% of exports and 32.1% of imports. Outside the EU, the United States accounted for 23.2% of exports and 14.1% of imports in 2010.",

Bangkok alone accounts for 48.4 percent of Thailands service sector, which in turn constitutes 49.0 percent of GDP. When the Bangkok Metropolitan Region is considered, manufacturing is the most significant contributor at 28.2 percent of the gross regional product, reflecting the density of industry in the Bangkoks neighbouring provinces.

In the second quarter, the Broncos took the lead with Cutler's 1-yard TD pass to FB Cecil Sapp, along with rookie DE Tim Crowder returning a fumble 50 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, the Steelers tried to come back with Roethlisberger completing a 13-yard TD pass to WR Santonio Holmes.  Fortunately, Denver answered with Cutler completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler.  In the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh managed to tie the game with Roethlisberger completing a 13-yard TD pass to TE Matt Spaeth and a 12-yard TD pass to Miller.

        "passage": "Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Cardinals, the Bengals stayed at home, donned their alternate uniforms, and played a Week 12 duel with the Tennessee Titans.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati pounced first with RB Rudi Johnson getting a 5-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Titans answered with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 28-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Bengals responded with QB Carson Palmer completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Chad Johnson.  Tennessee would end the half with Bironas nailing a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cincinnati began to pull away as RB Kenny Watson managed to get a 6-yard TD run, while Palmer hooked up with Chad Johnson on a 2-yard TD pass.  In the fourth quarter, the Bengals sealed the victory with Palmer hooking up with Chad for the third time on a 3-yard TD pass. Chad Johnson (12 receptions for 103 yards and 3 touchdowns) ended the game as the Bengals' All-Time receptions leader with 531.  Also, this marked the third time in his career that he caught 3 touchdown passes in one game.",

In the first quarter, the Lions trailed as Vikings RB Artose Pinner (a former Lion) got a 3-yard and a 4-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Detroit's struggles continued as Vikes QB Brad Johnson got a 3-yard TD run, yet the 2-point conversion failed.  Afterwards, the Lions finally got on the board with DB Jamar Fletcher returning an interception 88 yards for a touchdown, while kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 53-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Detroit held Minnesota to a 30-yard field goal by kicker Ryan Longwell, while Hanson kicked a 45-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Pinner wrapped things up for the Vikings with a 1-yard TD run.  Even though the Lions would get a touchdown, from QB Jon Kitna's 23-yard strike to RB Kevin Jones, Detroit was plagued with 6 turnovers.  They pulled within 10 in the 4th qtr and had a fourth and goal with less than four minutes to play. Needing two scores, inexplicably the Lions went for a touchdown and failed, thus killing any hope for a last minute victory. With their fifth-straight loss, the Lions fell to 2-11.",

        "passage": "After establishing the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang began to consolidate the authority of the royal court. He assigned territories to the members of the royal family and stationed them across the empire. These members of the royal family did not have the administrative power over their territory, but they were entitled to a personal army that ranges from 3,000 to 19,000 men. Royal members that were stationed in the northern frontier were entitled to even larger forces. For instance, the Prince of Ning was said to have an army of over 80,000 men. The original crown prince Zhu Biao died at 36 in 1392, and his son Zhu Yunwen was made the crown prince. Zhu Yunwen was the nephew of the territorial princes, and he felt threatened by their military power. In May 1398, Zhu Yunwen ascended to the throne and became the Jianwen Emperor after the death of Zhu Yuanzhang. The princes were ordered to stay in their respective territories as the new emperor began planning for the reduction of their military power with his close associates Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng.",

        "passage": "The Chargers host the Ravens in their home debut in San Diego after a narrow escape in the second of two AFL 50th Anniversary-themed division rivalry Monday Night matchups against the Raiders in Oakland. The Chargers jumped out to an early lead when a blown coverage led to an easy 81-yard touchdown pass from Philip Rivers to Darren Sproles. The Ravens answered with Willis McGahee on a 5-yard touchdown run, but the Chargers would increase their advantage on a Nate Kaeding field goal. The offensive display would continue in the second quarter, but the Ravens touchdowns were only answered by Chargers field goals. McGahee found the end zone a second time to take the lead 14 - 10, but the Chargers pulled within one on the second Kaeding field goal. Flacco then found Kelley Washington for Flacco's first touchdown pass of the day and Washington's first touchdown reception as a Raven just inside the 2-minute halftime warning. Rivers led the Chargers down the field in an attempt to answer, but the drive stalled and had to settle for the third of four Kaeding field goals. In the second half, both defenses stiffened. Todd Heap would get his second touchdown catch of the season from Flacco from 9 yards out, but the Chargers responded with a 35-yard touchdown catch from Vincent Jackson. Late in the fourth quarter, interceptions from Flacco and Rivers led to trading field goals. After a Ravens punt, Rivers led the Chargers all the way down to the Ravens 15. The Chargers went for the first down on fourth down to go for the win, but Sproles was stopped by Ray Lewis five yards in the backfield, allowing the Ravens to run the clock out. With the win, not only do the Ravens improve to 2-0, the Ravens take sole possession of first place in the AFC North with the Steelers' loss to the Bears.",

The Hurricanes, however, turned out to be one of the NHLs biggest surprises, turning in the best season in the franchises 34-year history. They finished the regular season with a 52\u201322\u20138 record and 112 points, shattering the previous franchise records of 94 points (in the WHA) set by the 1972\u201373 Whalers and 93 points (in the NHL) set in 1986\u201387 NHL season. It was the first time ever that the franchise had passed the 50-win and 100-point plateaus. The 112-point figure was good for fourth overall in the league, easily their highest overall finish as an NHL team (tied with the third-overall Dallas Stars in points, but with one fewer win than the Stars) and second in the East (one point behind the Ottawa Senators). The Hurricanes also ran away with their third Southeast Division title, finishing 20 points ahead of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Attendance increased from 2003\u201304, averaging just under 15,600 per game, and the team made a profit for the first time since the move from Hartford.",

After forcing the Steelers to punt on the opening drive, the Patriots marched 70 yards in just 8 plays, scoring on a 19-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski. After the Steelers punted, the Patriots drove to the 12, but the Steelers #1 ranked defense tightened down, and forced the Patriots to a 30-yard field goal by Shayne Graham, increasing their lead to 10-0. Two possessions later, The Steelers drove to the Patriots 4, but settled for a 22-yard field goal by Jeff Reed, making the score 10-3. Both teams punted for the rest of the half and the Patriot led 10-3 at halftime. The Patriots opened up a scoring barrage in the 2nd half. On the opening possession of the 3rd quarter, the Patriots marched 78 yards in a perfectly balanced 10 play (5 passes, 5 rushes) drive, scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski, increasing their lead to 17-3. After both teams punted, the Steelers drove 59 (aided by a 38-yard pass interference call on Brandon Meriweather)yards to the Patriots 8-yard line, but Reed missed a 26-yard field goal. The Patriots took advantage, marching 80 yards in 7 plays, scoring on Brady's 3-yard touchdown run, with a missed extra point, increasing the Patriots lead to 23-3. The Steelers countered on their next drive, racing 71 yards in 7 plays, scoring on a 6-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Emmanuel Sanders, trimming the deficit to 23-10. After the Patriots punted, Roethlisberger was intercepted by James Sanders who returned the interception 32 yards for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 29-10 after the missed two point conversion. Sanders returned the ensuing kick 26 yards to the Patriots 47 and the Steelers raced 53 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a 15-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace, with a successful two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to 29-18. After recovering the onside kick, the Patriots put the game away, marching effortlessly, 41 yards in only 5 plays, scoring on a 25-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, his third touchdown reception of the game, giving the Patriots an insurmountable 36-18 lead with 4:23 remaining. Ben Roethlisberger completed four passes, all to Mike Wallace on the next drive, including a 33-yard touchdown pass, with another successful 2 point conversion, trimming the deficit to 36-26, but the Patriots' Alge Crumpler recovered the onside kick. Graham added the final points of the game with a 36-yard field goal, bringing the score to 39-26. Pittsburgh drove to New England's 15 with a few seconds left, but couldn't score. Tom Brady finished 30/43 for 350 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions against the top-ranked defense in the NFL. Rob Gronkowski caught all three TDs en route to a 5 catch, 72 yard night. Ben Roethlisberger threw for 387 yards in defeat. With the win, New England improve to 7-2.",

        "passage": "Following the conquest of the temple fort , later known as Jaromarsburg, on Arkona in 1168 by the Danes under King Valdemar I and Bishop Absalon of Roeskilde, the princes of R\u00fcgen had to recognise Danish suzerainty. On their accession to power, the R\u00fcgen princes were forced to confirm their allegiance to the Danish king and were obliged to provide military support to the Danes. In 1304 Vitslav III of R\u00fcgen gained sole lordship over the territory on the death of his brother, Sambor. Because he had no issue at that point in time, there existed the possibility that R\u00fcgen's princely house could become extinct. As a result, in 1310 he agreed a contract of inheritance at Ribnitz with the Danish king, Eric VI Menved, his feudal lord. The agreement was that in the event of Vitslav dying without issue, the fiefdom of R\u00fcgen would be returned to the Danish crown. At that time, Eric VI Menved was attempting to extend his power in the southern Baltic Sea region in order to reduce the influence of Hanseatic towns like Stralsund. To assist him, in addition to the princes of R\u00fcgen, the king also had Prince Henry II of Mecklenburg as a vassal. After the death of Eric VI Menved in 1319, the 1310 treaty lapsed and Vitslav III sought allies in the Pomeranian dukes. On 5 May 1321 dukes Otto I of Pomerania, Vartislav IV of Pomerania-Wolgast and Barnim II of Pomerania-Stettin agreed a mutual inheritance contract with Vitslav III of R\u00fcgen. But in an alliance agreement that had been previously concluded on 25 October 1315 between Vartislav IV, the son of Vitslav's sister, Margaret, and Eric's brother, Christopher of Halland, who later became King Christopher II of Denmark, Vartislav IV had already been promised the R\u00fcgen fiefdom.",

In the second quarter, they trailed after kicker Graham Gano nailed a 46-yard field goal. The Bears' offense broke through as QB Jay Cutler got a 9-yard TD pass to WR Johnny Knox, but was closed off in the third quarter as Cutler's pass was intercepted by DeAngelo Hall and returned 92 yards for a touchdown.

        "passage": "The Indianapolis Colts came into a crucial divisional matchup with the Jacksonville Jaguars, with added importance after the season opening loss to the Texans.  With the first possession of the ballgame, the Colts drove down the field with a mix of pass and run plays, scoring the opening touchdown of the game.  However, Jacksonville returned the favor by going 76&#160;yards to tie the game up, and by the end of the first quarter the game was tied at 7-7.  In the second quarter Maurice Jones-Drew scored on a touchdown run giving the Jaguars their first lead of the day, with the Colts eventually responded and tying the up 14-14 going into halftime.  With the beginning of the second half both teams failed to score on their next possessions, with the Colts punting to the Jaguars midway through the third quarter.  David Garrard threw his first touchdown pass of the day, giving the Jaguars a 21-14 lead towards the end of the third quarter.  With the Colts trailing midway through the fourth quarter, Peyton Manning drove the team down the field to score on a Joseph Addai run.  With the Jaguars responding and the Colts driving down the field to tie with 0:52 left, the game was a 28-28 with less than thirty seconds in the game.  Jacksonville was able to get two big plays on their last drive of the game setting up Josh Scobee for a 59-yard field goal, which was good.  The Indianapolis Colts started 0-2 in the AFC South for the first time following this loss, dropping out of first place and falling behind the Houston Texans.",

        "passage": "The Patriots began their season at home with an AFC duel against the Cincinnati Bengals. After a Bengals punt, the Patriots scored the first points of the game, racing 72 yards in 5 plays, scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Tom Brady to Wes Welker. Following a Bengals punt, the Patriots marched all the way to the Bengals 14, but had to settle for a 32-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski, extending the lead to 10-0. On the third play of the Bengals next drive, Cedric Benson  fumbled with Rob Ninkovich recovering at the Bengals 34. The Patriots only gained 4 yards and Gostkowski missed a 47-yard field goal, keeping the score 10-0. After another Bengals punt, the Patriots engineered a 10 play, 80-yard drive, scoring on another touchdown pass from Brady to Welker, widening the lead to 17-0. The Bengals reached Patriots territory for the first time on their next drive, but Gary Guyton intercepted Carson Palmer at the 41 and returned it 59 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a big 24-0 lead. The Bengals finally struck on their next drive, driving to the Patriots 35, and Mike Nugent hitting a 53-yard field goal, making the score 24-3. After Ben Tate returned the ensuing kick 38 yards to the Patriots 32, the Patriots reached the Bengals 37, but Gostkowski missed the 55-yard field goal attempt wide right. Palmer connected with Jordan Shipley for a 51-yard gain on the last play of the first half, but they couldn't reach the end zone and the Patriots led 24-3 at halftime. Tate returned the opening kickoff of the second half 97 yards for a touchdown, blowing the game open 31-3. The Bengals countered with a 12 play, 85-yard drive, in just under seven minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Palmer to Jermaine Gresham, trimming the deficit to 31-10. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Bengals continued their comeback, marching 74 yards in 12 plays, scoring on a 28-yard touchdown pass from Palmer to Chad Ochocinco, trimming the deficit to a manageable 31-17. The Patriots ended any hope of a Bengals comeback on their next drive, engineering a 14 play, 81-yard drive, in nearly eight minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to rookie Rob Gronkowski, increasing the lead to 38-17 midway through the fourth quarter. The Bengals answered, racing 76 yards in under four minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Benson, bringing the score to 38-24 with just under four minutes to play and giving the Bengals some hope, but the Patriots got the ball after Malik Johnson was flagged for illegal touch on the onside kick. The Patriots drove all the way to the Bengals 7 and turned the ball over on downs, draining over two minutes off the clock. The Bengals ran out the rest of the clock and the Patriots won the game.",

        "passage": "Growth in 2000-05 was supported by exports to the EU, primarily to Germany, and a strong recovery of foreign and domestic investment. Domestic demand is playing an ever more important role in underpinning growth as interest rates drop and the availability of credit cards and mortgages increases. Current account deficits of around 5% of GDP are beginning to decline as demand for Czech products in the European Union increases. Inflation is under control. Recent accession to the EU gives further impetus and direction to structural reform. In early 2004 the government passed increases in the Value Added Tax  and tightened eligibility for social benefits with the intention to bring the public finance gap down to 4% of GDP by 2006, but more difficult pension and healthcare reforms will have to wait until after the next elections. Privatization of the state-owned telecommunications firm \u010cesk\u00fd Telecom took place in 2005. Intensified restructuring among large enterprises, improvements in the financial sector, and effective use of available EU funds should strengthen output growth.",

Despite the Seahawks' offense failing to score a single point, Josh Brown had a big day, as he provided all of the Seahawks' points.  He kicked a 20-yarder, a 50-yarder, and a 42-yard field goal as time expired to win the game. Meanwhile, the defense limited the Lions to just two field goals. With the win, the Seahawks started out the season at 1-0. On September 11, the Seahawks announced they had acquired wide receiver Deion Branch in a trade with the New England Patriots. In return, they gave their first-round pick in the 2007 NFL Draft to the Patriots.",

        "passage": "Dunstable, New Hampshire was a town located in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire. It has been divided into several current cities and towns, including Nashua, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimack. The town was originally part of a larger town of Dunstable, Massachusetts, when Massachusetts stretched from Rhode Island up to Maine. The original tract of land was bisected by the Merrimack River, an important route for the lucrative fur and log trade. Dunstable was incorporated as a township in 1673. On July 3, 1706, during Queen Anne's War, tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy raided the town, killing nine while seven of the natives were killed. When the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border was surveyed and adjusted in 1741, the northern part of the town was determined to be in New Hampshire, and was incorporated as a New Hampshire town in 1746. Both the northern New Hampshire half and the southern Massachusetts half prospered, and various villages were formed along the Merrimack, but also along Salmon Brook, the Nashua River, Pennichuck Brook, and the Souhegan River, which also ran through the tract. Over the years, other towns were formed from parts of the original area on both sides of the state line, and in 1836 the remaining part that still bore the name of \"Dunstable, New Hampshire\" was renamed \"Nashua\", after the name of the river that flowed into the Merrimack at the location then referred to as \"Indian Head\". Six years later Nashua split into \"Nashville\" and \"Nashua\", but in 1853 they rejoined and became the \"City of Nashua\". The name Nashville is preserved in the city's Nashville Historic District, and the name Dunstable can still be found in the streets \"New Dunstable Road\", \"Main Dunstable Road\", and \"East Dunstable Road\" .",

        "passage": "Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Texans, the Titans went home for a crucial Week 16 battle with the Pittsburgh Steelers, with the AFC's top seed on the line. After a scoreless first quarter, the Titans got the second quarter lead as kicker Rob Bironas got a 42-yard field goal, along with quarterback Kerry Collins completing a 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Justin Gage. The Steelers would respond with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing a 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Santonio Holmes. In the third quarter, Pittsburgh took the lead as Roethlisberger completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hines Ward, yet Tennessee struck back with rookie running back Chris Johnson getting a 21-yard touchdown run. The Titans would then pull away in the fourth quarter with running back LenDale White's 1-yard touchdown run and safety Michael Griffin's 83-yard interception return for a touchdown. This was the first game of the year where the league-leading Steelers defense allowed more than 300 yards of total offense (allowing 332 yards). With the win, not only did Tennessee improve to 13-2, but they also locked up the AFC's #1 seed. This would be the Titans last win until Week 8 of the 2009 season. This would also be the last time a team swept both the AFC and NFC North in the same season until the Dallas Cowboys did it during the 2016 season.",
