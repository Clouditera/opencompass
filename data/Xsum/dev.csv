Rosell, speaking at a news conference after a Barca board meeting, insisted he had ""acted correctly"".
Vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu now takes over from the 49-year-old Rosell, who came to power in 2010.
Rosell's future has been a real source of concern ever since a Spanish national court judge accepted a lawsuit this week from Barcelona club member Jordi Cases, who alleged that the amount paid for Neymar was more than the reported fee.
Rosell maintains the accusation is ""unfair and reckless"".
He added: ""For some time, my family and myself have suffered threats and attacks in silence. These threats and attacks have made me wonder if being president means having to jeopardise my family.
""From the beginning, I have said the signing of Neymar has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries.""
Rosell said he was resigning to spare the club's board of directors from ""unfair attacks"" that could ""negatively affect their management or the image of the club"".
He added: ""It has been an honour to serve the Barcelonistas. It's been a privilege to be the president of FC Barcelona.""
Rosell was named Barca president in the summer of 2010 after winning a landslide vote to succeed Joan Laporta, earning 61.34% of a record turn-out of 57,088 voters.

38663542,"The think tank said the city's 1,536 schools needed to save £360m in the first year if the government's National Funding Formula (NFF) plan goes ahead.
The amount is the equivalent of 12,857 qualified teachers, on an average salary of £28,000.
The government said London was the highest funded part of the country.
It added that under the plans, which are under consultation, inner-city schools would be allocated 30% more money per pupil than the national average.
But London Councils, which represents the city's 32 boroughs and the City, said no school would gain enough funding from the NFF to compensate for increased cost pressures from inflation, higher pension contributions and national insurance.
Ministers said the new formula was needed to tackle uneven levels of funding across England, with the best funded areas getting more than £6,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded averaging £4,200.
It said the funding cut was on top of National Audit Office figures which showed England schools faced an eight per cent real-terms cut per pupil by 2019-20 because it  wider cost pressures.
In a statement, London Councils said: ""At a time when UK schools are seen as underperforming by international standards, and when businesses based in London are facing massive uncertainty about recruiting skilled staff, there is an urgent need to invest in schools in London and across the rest of the country.""
It added: ""Without the right qualifications and skills, London's children will be unable to access jobs and contribute to the national economy. Over 60% of jobs in inner London require a degree and around 45% of jobs in the rest of the capital require a degree.""","About 70% of London schools could face budget cuts under government plans to change how they are funded, according to London Councils."

Separately, Ms Cooper warned there was a ""serious risk the party will split"" if the left-winger becomes its leader.
It comes as Labour begins sending out the first ballot papers to voters.
The result of the contest will be announced at a special conference on 12 September.

Meanwhile voting in the election for the new Scottish Labour leader ended at midday.
Mr Corbyn is due to unveil a 10-point policy plan while in Glasgow later.
The popularity of the left-wing Islington North MP, who is promising ""a new kind of politics"", has sparked a row about the future direction of the Labour party.
Another leadership contender, Andy Burnham, told the BBC Mr Corbyn's policies ""lack credibility"".
""It's not possible to promise free university education, re-nationalising the utilities, without that coming at a great cost and if you can't explain how that is going to be paid for then I don't think we'll win back the trust of voters on the economy,"" he said.
BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said there had been ""frustration"" in rival camps who accused Mr Burnham of being reluctant to take on Mr Corbyn. This appeared to be his most direct attack yet, he added.
But in an interview with Jeremy Vine on BBC Radio 2, Mr Burnham declined to follow Ms Kendall and Ms Cooper and advise his supporters not to back Mr Corbyn with their second and third preferences.
He added: ""People will say if they hear things like that, 'hang on, what do you believe?'""
In an interview with The Independent, Ms Kendall called for voters to mark Ms Cooper or Mr Burnham as second and third preferences, and avoid giving votes to Mr Corbyn.
""I have set out very clearly where I differ with all the candidates but our differences with Jeremy's kind of politics are far greater,"" said Ms Kendall.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme she said she ""can't pretend to be agnostic"" about a victory for Mr Corbyn, saying of the voting process: ""It is an alternative vote system and I want to urge party members to use all of their different preferences.
""I will be using my second and third preferences and I would urge others to do the same because I don't want to see our party go back to the politics of the '80s, just being a party of protest.""
The Leicester West MP also said she did not see the party splitting, as it did in the 1980s when Labour members formed the Social Democratic Party.
However, Ms Cooper told BBC 2's Newsnight: ""I think there is a serious risk that the party will split, will polarise and I cannot bear to see that happen because there is too much at stake.""
Asked in an interview with grassroots Labour website Labourlist whether voters should use their votes to try to prevent Mr Corbyn winning, she said: ""I think people should use all of their preferences.
""And I think the focus has to be how do we make sure we can win that election, and that's the most important thing - and I don't think Jeremy can do that.""
Mr Corbyn has warned against ""personal abuse"" in the campaign, saying he wants to focus on policy.
His policy programme includes a commitment to ""growth not austerity"", nationalising the railways and energy sector, and a plan for nuclear disarmament.
In an essay for the Fabian Society he also suggested Labour's new increased following should be more involved in the party and proposed a review of membership fees to make the party more ""inclusive"".
Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is expected to join the debate over the leadership contest with a speech on Sunday, called ""power for a purpose - the future of the Labour Party"".
Lance Price, former director of communications for Labour, told the BBC the contest had been an ""unedifying mess"" and had ""done nothing to reengage the labour party with those millions of people who deserted it"".
The Guardian newspaper has endorsed Ms Cooper for the leadership while the Daily Mirror has given its backing to Mr Burnham, although the paper urged him to ""find a role"" in his team for Mr Corbyn, who it says has ""lit up the election campaign"".",Labour leadership hopefuls Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper have said their supporters should back anyone other than Jeremy Corbyn in the contest.
39220527,"The Association of School and College Leaders says England's schools have had to make more than £1bn savings this year, rising to £3bn by 2020.
The government says school funding is at a record £40bn, with rises ahead.
Education Secretary Justine Greening will hear heads' cash grievances at Friday's ASCL conference in Birmingham.
She is due to address the union, which has published a survey of its members on the issue.
It suggests schools are finding it difficult to make savings without cutting provision and that things are predicted to get worse over the next two years.
Cost pressures are rising as greater pay, pension and national insurance costs are having to be covered from school budgets.
ASCL complains a new funding formula for schools has reduced the basic level of school funding going forwards by too much.
The meeting comes two days after requests for more money to spend on daily school costs were ignored by the chancellor in the Budget.
Philip Hammond however did pledge £500m for school buildings, mainly new free schools - some of which could be grammar schools.
One respondent said his school was moving to a ""bare bones education"", in which ""the components that make education special and enjoyable are being eroded away"".
Some 95% of the 1,054 heads, deputies and senior teachers responding to the survey said they had cut back on support services - including equipment and materials, as well as mental health and special needs support.
More than eight out of 10 said class sizes had increased - a claim strongly refuted by the Department for Education.
And more than two-thirds said they had cut back on activities like clubs and trips.
Just under three-quarters of respondents with GCSE-level classes said they had cut courses and just over three-quarters of heads with A-level students said they had also reduced subjects.
Foreign modern languages, music, arts and drama were among subjects removed at A-level.
Another said: ""Through no fault of their own, students will have restricted subject choices, in larger class sizes with less pastoral support, whilst still being expected to perform at the highest of standards - nonsense!""
One head said his school may have to axe its sixth form provision for next year and another said his school was starting to ""creak"" with all staff working to full capacity.
Interim general secretary, Malcolm Trobe, said: ""School leaders will do their utmost to protect provision, as they always do, but they cannot provide everything that is asked of them without the resources they need.
""Unless the government invests more in the education system, there will be a significant impact on the lives and life chances of young people.""
A spokesman for the DfE said: ""As this week's Budget demonstrates, the government is determined to ensure every child has access to a good school place and is given the opportunity to fulfil their potential.
""The government has protected the core schools budget in real terms since 2010, with school funding at its highest level on record at more than £40bn in 2016-17 - and that is set to rise, as pupil numbers rise over the next two years, to £42bn by 2019-20.""","Head teachers say they are axing GCSE and A-level subjects, increasing class sizes and cutting support services as they struggle with school funding."

A brawl erupted but the attackers fled before police arrived.
Police are now investigating, and say they have questioned the attackers and cafe staff. Nobody has been arrested.
The cafe has appealed for public support, saying it was no prank but a case of intimidation by neo-Nazis.
The attackers wore strings of sausages round their necks and threw chunks of meat onto customers' plates, the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie reports from Tbilisi.
They are known as the Bergmann group, and a social media page shows their attacks on people of Arab or African origin, our correspondent reports. One photograph shows members making the Nazi salute.
The Kiwi cafe is in a traditional part of old Tbilisi, and is popular among young people sporting unconventional hairstyles, tattoos and body piercings.
Most Georgians are Orthodox Christians and many see unorthodox lifestyles as a corrupting influence from the West.
The cafe said it had drawn some local hostility because of ""the way we look, music that we listen to, ideas we support, and the fact that we don't eat meat"" and backing of causes such as rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.
""During these hard times you can support us just by visiting our cafe, we will be very grateful if you come to show everyone that here are a lot of us who care about the issue!"" the Kiwi cafe said in a statement on Facebook.
It later told the BBC it had received strong messages of solidarity - from Georgia and abroad - but that people had also left angry comments trying ""to defend those fascists"".
It said it was also appealing for financial contributions to install security cameras in case of repeat incidents.
The incident comes amid growing concerns about the rise of far-right nationalism in Georgia.
Last week, hundreds of nationalists marched through central Tbilisi - waving Georgian flags and anti-communist banners, reports said - to mark independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Homophobia is also commonplace in Georgia, correspondents say. The country made world headlines in 2013 when a small group of LGBT activists were attacked by a large mob led by an orthodox priest.
The cafe statement blames Sunday's incident on the group of men who came into the premises, talking loudly, throwing meat and smoking, and then ""yelling, laughing, and talking to us sarcastically"".
These people ""were neo-Nazis... who support fascist ideas"", the cafe said.

Bradshaw says he was ""gutted"" to miss out on Wales' memorable Euro 2016 campaign after a calf injury ruled him out of contention.

28688331,"John MacIntosh, 46, of Dingwall, must serve at least 10 years in prison after being convicted by a jury of four serious sexual offences.
At the High Court in Aberdeen, judge Lord Uist said MacIntosh was a ""sexual fiend"" who targeted vulnerable females.
MacIntosh had previously been jailed for seven years for having sex with 13 and 14-year-old girls.
The offences heard at the High Court in Aberdeen happened in the Inverness and Dingwall areas between 1996 and 2004.
He sexually assaulted and attempted to rape the young girl and raped three women.
In his sentencing statement, Lord Uist said: ""You targeted vulnerable females in order to gratify your carnal lust.
""You have called all these women liars and shown no remorse for what you did.""
The judge added: ""It is clear to me that you have no respect for women and are a sexual fiend.""
Lord Uist said MacIntosh should not assume that he would be automatically released after having served 10 years in prison.
He said: ""You will be released only when the Parole Board for Scotland is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that you continue to be held in prison.""
Police Scotland has welcomed the life sentence.
Det Insp Eddie Ross said the case was brought to the attention of police by the NHS.
He said: ""During the investigation there was also significant involvement from the local authority in terms of housing and social work support for not only the victims but also their children.
""However, the most important people in all this are the victims and I must pay tribute to them in both coming forward to the police and staying with the prosecution process to conviction.
""I hope that this result will bring some comfort to the victims in this case and give confidence to anyone who has suffered similar experiences to come forward in the knowledge that their case will be sensitively and thoroughly investigated.""",A man who attempted to rape a young girl and raped three women has been jailed for life.
40232491,"A spokesman for the governor in Nangahar province said an Afghan commando had opened fire on the US troops during a joint operation in Achin. He was shot dead in return fire.
Another US soldier was reportedly wounded in the attack.
A spokesman for the Taliban said it had carried out the attack.
Islamic State militants also operate in the area.
Earlier, at least two Afghan policemen were killed by US forces in a so-called friendly fire incident in southern Afghanistan.
The deaths are said to have occurred when a US aircraft returned fire during a joint operation in the restive province of Helmand.
It is reported to be the first friendly fire incident in Helmand since US Marines returned there in May.
Taliban insurgents have made widespread gains in the province.
In a statement, the US military apologised for the incident and said that an investigation had been launched.
It happened as police were on patrol in volatile Nad Ali district. The dead were members of the Afghan Border Police.
Afghan officials told AFP news agency that the policemen were patrolling too close to a Taliban base prior to the attack. They say a number of militants were also killed in the strike.
In recent months, the Taliban have captured several districts in Helmand and put provincial capital Lashkar Gah under pressure.
The arrival of hundreds of US Marines - following the withdrawal of US troops three years ago - is part of the Nato-led effort to train and assist Afghan forces. They include special forces who conduct separate counter-terrorism operations.
Air strikes by US warplanes have risen significantly over the last few months as President Donald Trump and other foreign leaders come under pressure to commit more troops.
Afghanistan has been hit by numerous violent attacks in recent weeks with the launch of the Taliban's spring offensive, including a massive bomb attack in the capital, Kabul, that killed more than 150 people.","Three US special forces soldiers have been shot dead by an Afghan colleague during an operation in eastern Afghanistan, US officials say."

36597220,"Cathay is one of the world's biggest cargo airlines, and its decision is expected to have a sizeable impact.
Previously, the airline had said it would only transport shark fin that was sustainably sourced.
Shark fin is considered a delicacy in Chinese cuisine and is often served as a soup at upmarket banquets.
More than 70 million sharks are killed every year, according to WWF figures. Large numbers are exported to Hong Kong, where they are consumed or further exported to mainland China.
""On the issue of shark's fin, with immediate effect we are happy to agree to ban the carriage,"" Cathay Pacific said in a statement on Wednesday.
It said it had not approved any shark fin shipments over the last year, pointing out that it had turned down 15 shipment requests for shark-related products.
Early reports said the ban extended to all shark products on cargo and passenger flights, but the airline told the BBC it currently applied to shark fin only,
Cathay said it would continue to review its policy.
Marine conservationists hailed Cathay's decision, with one proclaiming that it would make Hong Kong ""proud"".
""More Hong Kong businesses need to follow the lead,"" Hong Kong-based conservationist Sharon Kwok told AFP.
Government data cited by the South China Morning Post shows that shark fin imports to Hong Kong dropped by 42% between 2010 and 2015 to 5,717 tonnes.
During this period there was also a significant decline in imports by air.
Cathay now joins airlines including British Airways, American Airlines, Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Emirates in banning shark fin.",Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific has announced a ban on shipments of shark fin in a move that has been welcomed by conservationists.

30197084,"The 5,500-year-old Neolithic axe was found during archaeological surveys ahead of a multi-billion euro tunnel project.
The axe seems to have been jammed into what was once the seabed, perhaps as part of a ritual offering.
The lack of oxygen in the clay ground helped preserve the wooden handle.
The find was made in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland, which is to be connected to the German island of Fehmarn via the tunnel link.
""Finding a hafted [handle-bearing] axe as well preserved as this one is quite amazing,"" said Soren Anker Sorensen, an archaeologist at the Museum Lolland-Falster in Denmark.
Archaeologists have found other similarly well preserved organic material in the area during their excavations.
These include upright wooden stakes, a paddle, bows and other axe shafts.
Axes were vital tools for Stone Age people, who used them for working wood. However, they also played an important role during the introduction of farming to Europe, when the majority of the land was covered by dense forests.
The archaeologists suggest that the Neolithic communities of south Lolland may have been using the coast as an offering area.
Earlier this month, archaeologists working on the Fehmarn Belt Tunnel scheme announced that they had uncovered 5,000-year-old footprints along the edge of an ancient fish trap excavated at Rodbyhavn.",Archaeologists in Denmark have uncovered an incredibly rare find: a stone age axe held within its wooden handle.
39386676,"Trouble is, the aspen tree itself doesn't like to produce seeds which makes life very difficult for everyone.
But last year I visited Shropshire company Forestart and helped them out with their plans to get their aspens in a seed producing mood.
Forestart harvests a billion wild tree seeds every year to grow into new trees for planting.
You can read a blogpost about their plans here, but here's the general gist.
Aspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree.
That's no good for Forestart who need seeds to grow new aspens.
The last time aspens in Scotland flowered and produced seeds was twenty years ago.
So Robert Lee from Forestart had a plan. I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees.
Not all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk.
The idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds.
Well this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature.
Robert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see.
It's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year.
Can we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference?
Well yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree.
Those branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden.
It's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers.
The trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future.
Meaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees.
The only slight cloud on the horizon is if the whole effort is too successful, we get a lot of seeds and the local bird population treat the aspen seeds as a very expensive lunch.
Fingers crossed the siskins find something else to eat instead!",Aspens are one of our most beautiful native trees and there's a huge demand for seeds to grow new ones for planting.
36587997,"The hyperbaric chamber, which treats divers with ""the bends"", was operated by St John's Ambulance on a donation basis until it broke in April 2014.
The health department replaced it in 2015, but says it needs to ""balance the books"".
Diving instructor Steve Bougourd said he was ""gobsmacked"".
""I'm just worried that this kind of cost will put people off of actually going to the [hospital] and notifying them if they suspect a problem,"" he said.
""We may find it's going to be very expensive to get out divers insured.""
In the UK hyperbaric oxygen treatment is covered by the NHS, but Guernsey has its own health care system.
Source: NHS
Assistant director at Guernsey's health and social care department (HSC) Ed Freestone said renting the chamber was costing the government £60,000 a year.
He said the department would not make a profit from the new charges, which were based on ""the average usage that we could identify over the previous few years"".
In addition to paying for the training of staff and the maintenance of a 24 hour service, the department had to fund plans to buy its own chamber for about £250,000, Mr Freestone said.
Commercial divers already pay a £150 notification fee to dive which raises about £10,000 a year, according to HSC.
It is a legal requirement to provide a hyperbaric chamber facility for commercial diving activity to take place within Guernsey's 12-mile limit.","Divers in Guernsey will be hit with a £30,000 charge if they require treatment for decompression sickness, the government has confirmed."

Jews in the city of Ahmedabad, where the shop opened last month, said using the Nazi dictator's name was offensive. Israeli diplomats also raised the issue with the Gujarat state government.
The owners said they did not know who Adolf Hitler was when the shop opened.
Mr Shah told the BBC: ""Yes we are planning to change the name. There has been too much political pressure from the government.""
He said officials had promised compensation for the rebranding of the store, which sells men's clothing, although he said they had provided nothing in writing.
His co-owner, Manish Chandani, told AFP news agency they had never intended to glorify Hitler.
""I was not aware of Hitler being responsible for the killings of six million people before the shop's inauguration. This time I will choose a non-controversial name.""
Mr Chandani says the shop's name was a tribute to his grandfather who was nicknamed Hitler because he was ""very strict"".
Others saw the name as a marketing gimmick in a country where the former German leader attracts unusual interest in some sections of society.
""I am happy that the store owner decided to change the name. I guess he realised that it was not the right thing to do,"" Orna Sagiv, Israeli consul general in Mumbai, told AFP.",The owners of a new Indian clothing store called Hitler say they will rename it after receiving complaints.
33285699,"IS ""fired at everything that moved"" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says.
Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled.
IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa.
Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS ""caliphate"", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria.
""According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,"" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory.
He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey.
He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer.
The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes.
The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings.
Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms.
In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children.
Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town.
Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added.
Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months.
Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.","Islamic State (IS) militants have killed more than 120 civilians since launching a fresh attack on the Syrian border town of Kobane, activists say."

40445714,"The US Commerce Department said the economy grew at an annualised pace of 1.4% in the January-to-March period.
The rate was an upward revision from the previous estimate of 1.2%, which itself was an increase from the original reading of 0.7%.
However, it still marks a slowdown from the final quarter of 2016, when the economy grew at a rate of 2.1%.
The latest growth figure was helped by an increased estimate for growth in consumer spending, which was revised up to a rate of 1.1% from 0.6%.
""The economy is expanding at a solid, if unspectacular pace,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services.
Growth estimates in the first quarter are often weak, a quirk some say is due to the difficulty of measuring the effect of seasonal changes.
Thursday's update bolsters the perspective of the Federal Reserve, which increased interest rates in June.
Policymakers at the time said they did not believe the slowdown in the first quarter was the start of a trend, pointing to one-off factors, including a relatively mild winter.
Stronger-than-expected trade figures published Wednesday also led some to predict better growth in the second quarter.
Even so, many say growth for the year is all but certain to fall short of the 3% goal outlined by US President Donald Trump. Mr Faucher forecasts growth around 2.2% for the year.

32413443,"Class-A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine were among the illegal substances seized, according to the data from police in England and Wales.
There were more than 2,000 incidents dating back to 2011, suggest figures from 34 police forces.
Teachers described the statistics as a ""worry"" and the ""tip of the iceberg"".
The figures were obtained by the Press Association news agency (PA) under the Freedom of Information Act.
PA sent Freedom of Information requests to every police force in England and Wales asking how many times illegal drugs had been seized or confiscated from school premises in the period from March 2011 to the end of 2014.
The query asked for details of the type and amount of drug involved, its value, the type of school (primary or secondary) and details of who it was seized or confiscated from.
Just over three-quarters of forces replied.
Of these, 28 forces gave details of the types of drugs involved, 18 forces identified the type of school and 13 the ages of the individuals involved.
The data reveals cannabis was involved in 625 of the cases and cocaine in 27.
Other drugs confiscated included LSD, amphetamines and ecstasy.
Overall there were two cases each of heroin possession at schools in the West Midlands, Surrey and Greater Manchester, plus another in Hertfordshire.
Only four incidents involved children under 11.
An eight-year-old and a nine-year-old in Staffordshire were caught with cannabis, as was a 10-year-old girl at a Leicester primary school, while another 10-year-old in Greater Manchester was carrying £5 worth of the drug.
There were 241 incidents involving 15- to 16-year-olds and 231 incidents involving 11- to 14-year-olds.
In Greater Manchester, a 14-year-old was caught with heroin with a street value of £500, and a 16-year-old with a quantity worth £330.
Other incidents involved parents or school employees, including a school gardener in Humberside and a cleaner at a Manchester primary.
The highest number of incidents and offences in the three complete years to March 2014 was for Hampshire with 229 cases.
There were 144 incidents in Avon and Somerset and 138 in the West Midlands.
South Wales police reported 92 cases.
There was a slight year-on-year decrease in the numbers which peaked at 657 in 2011-12 and fell to 611 and 560 in the next two years, while in the period March to December 2014, there were 407 incidents.
Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said any incident of drugs on school premises was ""worrying as it will often only be the tip of the iceberg of what young people are encountering on the streets.

41001169,"Eighteen men, aged between 19 and 29 and some in prison, are banned from parts of Birmingham and must register phones and vehicles with police.
The two-year orders aim to disrupt gang-related violence between the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew.
West Midlands Police said it was ""a landmark ruling"".
The orders follow a spate of firearms offences in the city in 2015 and 2016, but the gangs have struck fear across parts of Birmingham for many years.
They gained notoriety in 2003 when their violent feud claimed the lives of two girls - Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis - outside a late-night new year party in the city. Four men were later jailed for life for their murders.
The gangs have also been behind countless drive-by shootings, drug dealing, intimidation, robberies and kidnappings.
After more recent incidents of gun crime in the city, West Midlands Police and the council sought to secure the injunctions in a civil case heard at Birmingham Crown Court earlier this year.
The force secured interim injunctions in 2016 and said at the time it did not want to identify anyone until they were permanent.  The BBC revealed their names after obtaining the county court documents.
More than 80 people from the Home Office and police gave evidence between February and June ahead of the orders being granted in July, which the force has revealed for the first time now.
Two have already been issued, three men are being sought by police and three properties were visited by officers on Wednesday.
The men are forbidden from associating with each other and entering the city centre, Handsworth, Newtown, Winson Green and Lozells.
In a copy of an injunction seen by the BBC, gang members are also banned from appearing in music videos that include material linked to the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew. One such music video was shown during the court proceedings.
Ten other men will receive the orders in jail where restrictions will be imposed on certain visitors to limit any gang associations, police said.
Among those to be given the injunctions in prison are two men believed to have been the ""armed response"" faction of the Burger Bar Boys.
Reial Phillips, 21, from Winson Green was jailed for 27 years last year after seven people were injured in a series of shootings during a feud with members of the Johnson Crew.
His co-defendant 23-year-old Ashai Gray, from Walsall, was jailed for nine years after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin.
Police said their actions ""brought fear"" to people in the West Midlands.
Gang injunctions came into force in England and Wales in 2011. Home Office figures show that between January 2011 and January 2014, 88 had been put in place.
The first one issued in the West Midlands was in 2012.
But solicitor Errol Robinson, who represented two of the four men jailed for the new year murders, criticised the move.
""They don't change behaviour or address underlying issues,"" he said.
""Injunctions become a bit of a trophy and encourage rebellion. Gang members like to show that they're not listening to orders so will breach orders.
""It's a cheap way of trying to solve crime but there is no evidence to suggest that they work.
""They're just a cosmetic gesture to show people that something is being done about gangs - but actually the results are minimum to none.""
From former gang members the BBC has spoken to, there is little support for the mechanism, BBC Midlands Correspondent Sima Kotecha said.
She said a number of gang members had said that if a person is banned from going to a certain part of a city, they will just go somewhere else and find others who have the same goal of causing violence and disruption.
Birmingham has seen another spike in gun and knife crime in 2017, with nine fatal stabbings this year. None of the men named in the injunctions are involved, police said.
Det Sgt Ian Comfort said: ""This is relatively new legislation and we believe that securing final full injunctions on such a large number of gang members is a UK first.
""The injunctions are applied for in the civil court in addition to sentences handed out by the criminal court for offences. They are an additional measure to help control the offenders and keep the community safe.""
Supt Mat Shaer, neighbourhood policing superintendent for Birmingham, said the injunctions were ""not sought lightly"" and the police, council and other groups had already made ""exhaustive efforts with these men"" and their families to try and steer them away gang culture.
Organised gangs in Birmingham have been a part of the city's life since the 1870s. Some have been mythologised on TV such as the Peaky Blinders.
But today's gangs linked to guns and drugs are far from glamorous and bring terror and misery to many people's lives.
The names Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew sprang on to the crime scene in the late 1990s.
Chaotic and quick to wreak violence, their crimes reached a crescendo one night at a new year's party in 2003 when two innocent teenage girls, Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis, died in a spray of machine gun fire in a drive-by shooting as members of the Burger Bar Boys attempted to kill a Johnson Crew man stood outside a Birmingham party.
That shocking display of gang callousness led to a concerted effort by government, police and the city council, and 10 years later it led some to believe that the gangs had been defeated as gun crime fell dramatically.
But in the last 18 months, a new generation of would-be gang members have arisen and shootings have begun to surge upwards.
Even in the last few weeks, the police have been shot at as they carried out an anti-gun operation in the Ladywood area of the city.
The men made subject to the injunctions",Two rival criminal groups have been hit with what police describe as the largest ever gang injunction.
37297193,"Gary Haggarty, 44, is no longer to be prosecuted for three alleged offences.
His lawyers said these relate to possessing explosives and firearms.
His legal team are also set to challenge the ""propriety"" of prosecuting a man they say worked as a state agent for some of the remaining 209 counts against him.
On Wednesday, Belfast Magistrates' Court was told that a hearing to decide if the suspected UVF commander-turned police informer has a case to answer is scheduled for November.
Mr Haggarty has been waiting to discover if he will stand trial since signing an agreement to become an assisting offender under the terms of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act (SOCPA) back in 2010.
The north Belfast man was charged with 212 charges covering a 16-year period between 1991 and 2007.
The prosecution case against him runs to 12,000 pages, with his alleged offences including:
Mr Haggarty, whose address is listed as c/o the Police Service of Northern Ireland, is believed to be living at a secret location in England.
He was not present for the latest stage in an ongoing court review of the case.
Outside court, Mr Haggarty's solicitor said a challenge would be mounted against some of the remaining charges.
""The defence forwarded written submissions to the PPS on 4 May dealing firstly with charges where we say the papers do not disclose a prima facie case, but also charges where there are issues in relation to the propriety of the charges at a time when the defendant was a state agent from 1993-2004,"" he said.
""""",Some charges against a so-called loyalist supergrass accused of a catalogue of murders and paramilitary crimes are to be dropped.
33643453,"Mr Gargan, 48, was found guilty of eight charges of misconduct but has been allowed to return to work.
The Avon and Somerset branch of the federation said it ""cannot envisage"" how the public or police can have ""confidence in his leadership"".
Mr Gargan said he understood people had questions and said he would address these.
In a statement issued through the Chief Police Officers Staff Association, he said he was ""very much looking forward to returning to work"" and ""beginning the process of rebuilding confidence in the force"".
The comments about his return to work were made in an open letter to Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens.
Mr Gargan was suspended following allegations of data protection breaches and inappropriate behaviour with women.
A panel found him guilty of misconduct - but cleared him of gross misconduct. His suspension was lifted and a phased return to work prepared.
Mr Gargan said his actions had ""fallen below the standards expected of a chief constable"".
In the letter seen by the BBC, the Police Federation said the chief constable is ""the person that sets the standard of professional behaviour and ethical conduct"" and the role ""must be beyond reproach"" in the eyes of the public and police officers.
It said its officers had been asked on a daily basis by ""the communities they serve"" how the chief constable ""can return to work in these circumstances"".
The letter ends with the federation calling on the commissioner to ""show strong leadership in dealing with this issue"".
Some former members of the force have also criticised Mr Gargan's return.
One group of retired officers said the ""debacle"" had caused ""more pain and damage to morale than is imaginable"".
Lawrie Lewis, a retired Chief Superintendent, said the force's reputation had been ""severely tarnished"".
Sue Mountstevens said: ""The procedure to be followed in relation to the sanction hearing is strictly regulated.
""As with all judicial processes when proceedings are not complete it is not possible to discuss or comment upon them until they have been finalised.""",The Police Federation has expressed a lack of confidence in Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan.
39953806,"Michael Bryn Jones, 39, from Llandudno, disappeared on 3 April 2016 after going to the door of the Hergest psychiatric unit at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor.
He was found hanging in woodland on 21 June.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) said it has already changed its procedures.
An inquest into Mr Jones' death heard he had been a patient at the Hergest unit until a few days before his disappearance and continued to suffer anxiety and paranoia after he left hospital.
He turned up at the unit in the early hours of 3 April and was sent to the accident and emergency department but left without booking in or speaking to anyone.
Robat Hughes, the senior nurse who spoke to Mr Jones at the unit, told the inquest he regretted not asking him whether he was already having treatment.
""He came to the door and asked to see a doctor, but I said there was no doctor there as she'd gone home sick.  I said that if he went to accident and emergency then there were doctors there,"" he said.
""He was relaxed and calm.  I didn't know if he was using mental health services and I didn't ask.
""I should have asked if he'd been having treatment.  It has been something I've thought about a lot since.""
Dr Stuart Porter, a consultant psychiatrist who reviewed the incident, said: ""Somebody should have taken Michael Bryn Jones to accident and emergency.  It's also good practice to follow that up with a phone call.""
In a statement, BCUHB said it offered ""sincere condolences"" to Mr Jones' family and ""fully accepted"" the coroner's findings.
""We have carried out our own thorough investigation, in conjunction with Michael's family, and as a result we have made changes to service provision,"" it added.
Recording a conclusion of suicide, coroner Nicola Jones said: ""There should have been more effort to persuade [Mr Jones] to come into the Hergest unit for a full assessment of his condition.
""He went to that unit looking for help, and he didn't get it.""","A man who went missing after going to hospital with mental health problems should have been given more help, a coroner has said."
39383896,"Wholesale prices have dropped and motoring organisations have suggested this merits reduced pump prices.
Tesco and Morrisons are cutting prices by 2p a litre on Friday, and Asda and Sainsbury's said they would reduce prices by up to 2p a litre on Saturday.
But drivers are being warned that prices can vary in different areas.
The average UK price for a litre of unleaded petrol was 118.83p on Thursday, and 120.88p for a litre of diesel, according to the latest figures from Experian Catalist.
Ten days earlier, the average unleaded price was 120p a litre, and diesel cost 122.06p.
The oil price and wholesale prices fell sharply at the start of March, and motoring organisations have argued that this should have been feeding through to another 2p cut per litre in prices at the pumps.
The RAC said motorists could feel ""aggrieved"" that prices had not fallen further, earlier.
Asda said it had dropped prices twice in two weeks, and had a national price cap to ensure motorists were dealt with equitably. Morrisons said it had also made a second cut in two weeks.
Tesco is dropping petrol and diesel prices by 2p a litre over the course of Friday afternoon at all its outlets, followed by Sainsbury's on Saturday.
Luke Bosdet, of the AA, said that there was general concern that so-called supermarket fuel price wars did not actually benefit all drivers across the country.
He claimed prices fell the most in areas where there were a range of supermarkets located close to each other. In other areas with less competition, the same cuts were not as likely to be seen.
""We would urge motorists to look around to find a better price. There are petrol price apps that can help,"" he said.",Motorists will see an acceleration in fuel price cuts over the weekend as supermarkets take up to 2p off a litre of petrol and diesel.

However, the council has admitted that there will never be a consensus on any flood protection proposal.
A report to a meeting of Dumfries and Galloway Council's environment committee next week will attempt to find a way forward.
What's happening in Scotland? Keep in touch through our live page.
Chairman Colin Smyth said: ""What we are now able to do is focus on what I think is the biggest issue as far as the public is concerned. In the draft proposal, the height of the embankment and the walls were simply too high and the public did not support that.
""What we now need to do is make sure that we find a solution that deals with the flooding, regenerates the Whitesands, solves the car parking issues, but also reduces the height of any proposed flood protection scheme.""
Water from the River Nith regularly spills over into the Whitesands, flooding a major town centre car park and nearby business premises.
Campaigners against the Â£15m proposal to build an embankment claimed it would have a detrimental effect on the town's main beauty spots.
They also raised concerns that the move would lead to the loss of about 200 waterfront car parking spaces.
David Slater, a local businessman who has been one of the project's most vocal objectors, said: ""However many other consultations they do now, public opinion will not change at this stage.
""It will be interesting to see how they can agree with the public to reduce the height of the bunds. There has to be better ideas because we can't put that in our town.""

34616758,"The towns of Virginia Water and Cobham, in Surrey, have become Britain's first million pound towns - where average house prices are more than £1m.
Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire is also in the millionaire's club, according to research by Lloyds Bank.
They are the first towns outside London where prices have hit seven figures.
The research was based on data from the Land Registry for the first half of 2015.
Prices in Virginia Water - home to the likes of Sir Cliff Richard and Sir Bruce Forsyth - average no less than £1.169m, making it Britain's most expensive town outside the capital.
No wonder that the town's famous golf course, Wentworth, feels able to charge joining fees of £125,000. That is on top of the annual membership fee of £16,000.
Cobham - familiar to Chelsea footballers and their WAGS - has average prices of £1.043m.
And anyone wanting to buy in Beaconsfield can expect to pay £1.003m.
""We're seeing the emergence of towns where the average price is at least £1 million,"" said Sarah Deaves, private banking director at Lloyds Bank.
""Whilst there are several London neighbourhoods where prices are already at this elevated level, outside of the capital this is a first.""
However the figures also show a sharp slow-down in the number of homes sold for more than £1m.
In the first half of 2015 there were 5,599 such sales, down from 6,303 in 2014. That amounts to an 11% fall.
One reason for that is the change in Stamp Duty rates, introduced in December 2014.

Izzet Eren was being held on remand at HMP Wormwood Scrubs accused of gun offences when he arranged for a gang to spring him from the van en-route to a hearing, Woolwich Crown Court was earlier told.

38372342,"They describe it as a kind of ""jet stream"" - a fast-flowing river of liquid iron that is surging westwards under Alaska and Siberia.
The moving mass of metal has been inferred from measurements made by Europe’s Swarm satellites.
This trio of spacecraft are currently mapping Earth's magnetic field to try to understand its fundamental workings.
The scientists say the jet is the best explanation for the patches of concentrated field strength that the satellites observe in the northern hemisphere.
""This jet of liquid iron is moving at about fifty kilometres per year,"" explained Dr Chris Finlay from the National Space Institute at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Space).
“That might not sound like a lot to you on Earth's surface, but you have to remember this a very dense liquid metal and it takes a huge amount of energy to move this thing around and that's probably the fastest motion we have anywhere within the solid Earth,” he told BBC News.
Dr Finlay was speaking here at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in San Francisco, just ahead of the official publication of the research in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Most people will be familiar with the atmospheric jet stream - the high-altitude, rapidly flowing belt of air on which aeroplanes ride to get to their destination more quickly.
Dr Finlay and colleagues want us to envision something similar but made of metal and 3,000km down, under our feet.
They assess the jet to be about 420km wide, and say it wraps half-way around the planet.
Its behaviour will be critical to the generation and maintenance of the global magnetic field, they add.
“It's likely that the jet stream has been in play for hundreds of millions of years,"" said Dr Phil Livermore from Leeds University, UK, and the lead author on the journal paper.
In the paper, the team puts forward a model to explain the jet.
The scientists say the feature probably aligns to a boundary between two different regions in the core.
They call this boundary the ""tangent cylinder"". They imagine this as a tube sitting around the solid inner core, running along Earth’s rotation axis.
When liquid iron approaches the boundary from both sides, it gets squeezed out sideways to form the jet, which then hugs the imaginary tube.
""Of course, you need a force to move fluid towards the tangent cylinder,"" said Prof Rainer Hollerbach, also from Leeds and another co-author on the paper.
""This could be provided by buoyancy, or perhaps more likely from changes in the magnetic field within the core.""
Although the team believes it understands how wide and how long the jet is, the depth to which it descends is far from certain.
Dr Livermore told BBC News: ""It currently wraps about 180 degrees around the tangent cylinder.  Although observations only constrain the jet stream on the edge of the core, our theoretical understanding suggests that the jet could in principle go very deep indeed - possibly in fact all the way down to the edge of the core in the southern hemisphere (i.e. at the other end of the tangent cylinder).""
That the team can make such inferences speaks to the impressive capabilities of the Swarm constellation.
Launched in November 2013, the European Space Agency satellites are providing unparalleled insights into the structure and behaviour of Earth's magnetic field.
With their highly sensitive instruments, they are gradually teasing apart the field's various components - from the dominant signal coming from the movement of iron in the outer core to the almost imperceptible contribution made by ocean currents.
It is  hoped the Swarm satellites’ data could ultimately tell us why Earth’s magnetic field has been weakening in recent centuries.
Scientists have speculated we could be on the cusp of a polarity reversal, which would see North become South, and South become North.
This occurs every few hundred thousand years.

Maybe. Maybe not.
But there are some significant ways Mr Trump is already altering his campaign strategy - sometimes in direct conflict with promises and assertions he made during his long, successful race to the top of the Republican Party.
Here are five.
Mr Trump has repeatedly boasted that he was paying for his campaign out of his own personal fortune.
""By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists,"" he posted on Facebook back in September. ""I am only working for the people of the US!""
Even though that's not exactly true - Mr Trump was loaning his campaign money and could someday pay it back, in addition to raising funds through donations - it was a central part of his pitch to those put off by the current political system.
Now, however, all pretence is gone. Mr Trump announced he's hired a veteran money man - a former Goldman Sachs partner, no less - as his national finance chairman. And on Tuesday he reached an agreement with the Republican Party to conduct joint fundraising through a network of committees that can take donations of up to $449,400 (Â£307,850) per person.
Mr Trump's move is an acknowledgement that he would be hard-pressed to self-finance a general election campaign, which could cost more than $1bn. He's wealthy - but he's not that wealthy.
Mr Trump has repeatedly insisted campaign-funded opinion polls are a waste of money.
""I don't have pollsters,"" he said last August. ""I don't want to be unreal. I want to be me. I have to be me. You know, we have enough of that in Washington, with pollsters telling everybody what to say and everybody being controlled by the special interests, and the lobbyists, et cetera, and the donors.""
In fact, Mr Trump was dismissive of the whole idea of data-driven campaigns - including President Barack Obama's winning presidential bids.
""Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine, and I think the same is true with me,"" he told the Associated Press.
That was before the Trump campaign hired Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, a veteran of the presidential campaigns of Rand Paul, Rick Perry and Bob Dole and a host of other state-level candidates.
Accurate, focused polling can serve as a presidential campaign's eyes and ears. It provides detailed information that helps a candidate's team determine where and how to spend resources.
At least that's what high-paid professional political pollsters will tell their candidates. And now Donald Trump is listening.
Like many Republicans, Mr Trump loved to make fun of Mr Obama's reliance on Teleprompters during public events.
""I've always said, if you run for president, you shouldn't be allowed to use Teleprompters,"" he said in October. ""Because you don't even know if the guy's smart.""
Part of Mr Trump's appeal was his off-the-cuff style. He could say anything at any time, no matter how controversial - compared to controlled, careful career politicians like Hillary Clinton.
""I watched Hillary the other day, and she has the biggest teleprompters I've ever seen,"" he said in January. ""In fact, if you're sitting on that side of the room or that side of the room you can't see her because when they are outside, they are painted black and you can't even see her.""
Then Mr Trump used a Teleprompter to deliver a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March. And he used one to give a foreign policy address in April.
His campaign has said that more substantive, scripted speeches are in store, including on the military, education reforms and the Supreme Court.
This, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the Washington Post, represents ""the natural maturation of the campaign"".
Over the course of his primary campaign Mr Trump hasn't been afraid to pick fights with fellow conservatives. He memorably sparred with Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly in the first Republican debate in August. He repeatedly criticised his party's foreign policy establishment. And he relentlessly disparaged the Republican Party leaders.
""They win their election, and they go to Washington, and they're with their wife or husband, and they say: 'Look at the beautiful columns. I don't want to leave this place, this is so beautiful,'"" Mr Trump said of Republican politicians in December. ""And they let us down.""
Now Trump has reunited with Kelly in a make-nice Fox interview. He's given a foreign-policy speech to a Washington think tank. He's made the rounds on Capitol Hill and ""planted seeds"" with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.
On Wednesday afternoon he even had a closed-door meeting with the dean of the conservative foreign-policy establishment, Henry Kissinger.
In the past Republicans have pivoted from the right to the political middle. Mr Trump, it seems, is pivoting from the outside to the inside.
On Wednesday Mr Trump released his much anticipated list of potential Supreme Court nominees. For an unconventional candidate, it was decidedly conventional.
While one judge, Don Willett of Texas, has an affinity for Twitter that almost rivals Mr Trump's, the list - eight men, three women, all white - is only surprising for its adherence to conservative orthodoxy.
It looks like it could have been the product of the right-wing Heritage Foundation. In fact, it largely was.
All of the names are judges currently on either state or federal courts, even though there is no constitutional requirement that Supreme Court nominees even be lawyers.
While no one was expecting Mr Trump to suggest Hulk Hogan or Sarah Palin for the high court, his list looks a lot like business as usual for a Republican presidential candidate.
That may be just he way he wants it - but it's also not exactly what his primary campaign was all about.","Donald Trump has effectively won the Republican presidential nomination, leaving pundits and analysts wondering if a rhetorical ""pivot"" to a general election campaign is in the works."

40993250,"At Turf Moor on Saturday, Burnley and West Brom played out a game in which the ball was in play for only 160 seconds more than it was out.
Though these are early days, no Premier League match so far this season has seen less action.
Two months ago, football's lawmakers revealed they were considering scrapping 45-minute halves, instead introducing two periods of 30 minutes, during which the clock would be stopped every time the ball went out.
The proposal, the International Football Association Board said, was one of a number of options to deter football's ""negativities"".
So would the rule have benefited supporters at Premier League matches so far this season? In a word, yes.
Of 19 top-flight games across the opening two weekends of the campaign, the ball has been in play for more than an hour in only two of them.
And no game has featured more than 61 minutes of play.
Food for thought for fans and lawmakers alike.
Here's the rest of the key Premier League statistics from the weekend.
It was a landmark weekend for Wayne Rooney as he joined Alan Shearer in the 200 Premier League goals club with his strike against Manchester City on Monday.
Here's how and when he has scored them.
Rooney has some way to go to beat former Newcastle and Blackburn striker Shearer's record of 260 goals, although his goal at Etihad Stadium was his fifth in his past eight Premier League games.
If he can keep that up then who knows...
... try, try again?
Well doing just that doesn't appear to be yielding results in the Premier League so far this season.
Harry Kane must have some sort of pox on him that prevents him from scoring in August, and it's hard not to sympathise as everything conspired to deny him a goal against Chelsea on Sunday.
He's attempted 14 shots so far this term - no player has managed more - all without reward.
""Obviously my decision not to read the British press was one of the best I ever made in my life.""
Judging by the above quote, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was perhaps getting a little tired of the criticism of his side's defending before they beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Saturday.
It was a welcome clean sheet after the Reds conceded three in their Premier League opener against Watford and then let in a late goal in the midweek 2-1 Champions League play-off win at Hoffenheim. But is their defence really a problem?
On the face of it, the statistics suggest it is. No team has made more errors that have led to goals than Liverpool since 2012, while the Reds have not managed to concede fewer than 40 goals a season since 2009-10.
A concern, no doubt, for a side with title ambitions. Only once in the past seven seasons has the Premier League been won by a side that has shipped 40 goals or more - Manchester United in 2012-13 (43).
However, things appear to be going in the right direction under Klopp. Liverpool conceded eight fewer goals last season than they did in the German's first at Anfield, while Saturday's result against Palace was a fifth clean sheet from their past six Premier League games, as many as in the previous 21.
The run of four clean sheets in Liverpool's final four games of last season came with Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren in the side. When they are able to start together, Liverpool are generally rock solid at the back - of the 18 league games they started last season, the Reds lost just once and kept eight clean sheets.
Possession football. Two words that will have Arsenal fans shuddering.
The Gunners often come out on top of the possession statistics but their game at Stoke on Saturday perhaps took the biscuit. With 77.3%, Arsene Wenger's side 'enjoyed' their highest possession figure in a single Premier League match since the 2003-04 season - yet lost 1-0.
It was a similar story for Tottenham. Against Chelsea in their first Premier League home game at Wembley, they threw everything (possibly including the kitchen sink) at the opposition goal, dominating the possession statistics with 68% of the ball - but ended up on the wrong side of a 2-1 result.
Clearly Chelsea were taking a leaf out of Burnley's books. Last weekend, the Clarets had just 38% possession compared with 62% for the Blues, but came away with the victory.
Javier Hernandez did what Javier Hernandez does best on Saturday - score from inside the box.
The former Manchester United striker returned to English football by joining West Ham in the summer and scored in the Premier League for the first time since April 2014 with a brace against Southampton. Just like his strike against Newcastle 1,232 days ago, both of those goals came from within 18 yards.
In fact, not one of Hernandez's 39 goals in the Premier League have been scored from outside the area, making him one of the most lethal close-range finishers to have played in England's top flight.
Hernandez's failure to score from outside of the box is not for the want of trying.
Against Southampton, the Mexico international had three shots on goal. Two from inside the box which ended up in the back of the net, the other from long range which, you've guessed it, went wide.
The fox in the box is very much in style. Of the 50 goals scored in the Premier League so far this season, only four have come from outside the area.
Life just continues to get better and better for Huddersfield fans.
The Terriers, back in the big time after a 45-year absence, made it two wins from two in the Premier League by beating Newcastle 1-0 on Sunday.
It means they are now only the third team in Premier League history to win their first two games following promotion. Bolton, in 2001-02, went to finish 16th and earn another stint in the top flight - but Hull City last season would go on to be relegated. A sign that the season is a marathon and not a sprint.
But perhaps youthful exuberance will see David Wagner's men continue to upset the odds. Huddersfield have named two of the four youngest starting XIs in the Premier League so far this season - and average age of 25 years and 143 days at Crystal Palace and 25 years 331 days against Newcastle.",A 90-minute match but only 47 minutes and 40 seconds of actual football.
36543080,"Twenty years ago today, Craig Brown's side faced England at Wembley at Euro 96 and encountered the kind of cruel fate that leaves a lasting regret.
Scotland were undone by misfortune and brilliance; two momentary interventions that extinguished their hopes. The performance overall was not bereft, which was in keeping with the tournament as a whole since Brown's team drew 0-0 with the Netherlands in the opening match and went on to defeat Switzerland 1-0.
Even so, the game still stands out in the long history of encounters between the Auld Enemy, for its circumstances, its drama and, to an extent, its heartache.
England needed to recover from a disappointing 1-1 draw with Switzerland in their opening game that exacerbated the criticism of the players. Manager Terry Venables had taken the squad to Hong Kong prior to the tournament, where some were pictured out drinking heavily.
Damage caused to the plane on the journey home brought further condemnation, while also building a siege mentality amongst the players and Venables, who had already announced he would be standing down after Euro 96 and would be succeeded by Glenn Hoddle.
Scotland were buoyed by holding the Dutch to a draw and although underdogs at Wembley, there was no sense of inferiority. Of the team that started the match, Colin Calderwood was at Tottenham, Colin Hendry had won the Premier League the year before with Blackburn (alongside England striker Alan Shearer), Gary McAllister was at Leeds and John Spencer was at Chelsea.
The rest of the team was made up of players from Aberdeen, Celtic and Rangers. For Scotland, naturally, the tie stirred memories of past excursions to Wembley and the fans mobilised en masse to London with a sense of living up to the zealous spirit of their predecessors.
The occasion worked with and against Scotland, though, since the England players were fired up by the historical significance of the game as much as the need to establish their worth at Euro 96. Before kick-off, England full-back Stuart Pearce could barely look at the Scots as they shook hands.
""You've got no friends when you play against a team like that,"" he later recalled.
It was a measure of Scotland's first-half performance that England used the interval to change their line-up. The game was still tied at 0-0, which suited Brown's side because the longer the game remained in the balance, the more doubt would enter the minds of the England players.
Venables was too wily to be outfoxed, though. Recognising that his side was not dominating possession enough to threaten, he brought on midfielder Jamie Redknapp at half-time. Eight minutes into the second half, Redknapp was involved in the move that resulted in Gary Neville crossing for Shearer to open the scoring with a header.
Scotland were not subdued by the goal, and Gordon Durie's header forced David Seaman to desperately claw the ball away.
Durie was involved in the next key moment, when he reached Stuart McCall's cross ahead of Tony Adams and was knocked over by the Arsenal defender's sliding challenge.
McAllister placed the ball on the spot, but as he ran to take his penalty kick, the ball rolled slightly. It was enough of a movement for Seaman to notice it and briefly wonder if the Scotland midfielder would stop and restart his run.
Instead, he struck the ball firmly but relatively straight, and Seaman blocked the spot-kick. McAllister later insisted that the movement of the ball was not an excuse for missing, but also insisted that if he had scored, he was convinced Scotland's momentum would have driven them to victory.
Instead, there was only further pain. Within 90 seconds the ball was worked out towards Paul Gascoigne, who lobbed it over Hendry then caught it on the volley to score past his Rangers team-mate, Andy Goram.
""You've got to hold your hand up at times and say it was a great piece of skill,"" Hendry later recalled.
Gascoigne ran to the byline and lay on his back while England players sprayed water into his mouth, mimicking the dentist's chair drinking game that had been caught on camera in Hong Kong.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The midfielder was typically mercurial, since it was his birthday the England players had been out celebrating in Hong Kong. He had been quiet in the opening match, too, and the Scotland bench were convinced Venables was about to replace him before he scored.
The England boss understood Gascoigne better than most, though, having worked with him at Tottenham as well.
The night before the Scotland game, Gascogine couldn't sleep and visited Venables in his hotel room. He confessed to being worried that he would not be selected for the game, and Venables told him he wouldn't be.
Even with the player in tears, Venables left him thinking that for 45 minutes, before telling him he was playing and to get off to bed to sleep.
Some of the Scotland players left the pitch feeling they had let their country down, while for many of the England players it was relief that underpinned their joy.
They went on to defeat the Netherlands 4-1, but Patrick Kluivert's consolation goal for the Dutch 12 minutes before the end meant Scotland were knocked out on goals scored, despite both countries finishing on four points and with a goal difference of minus one.
England reached the semi-final, only to lose to Germany on penalties. Their defeat was overseen by Berti Vogts, who led his country to the title, and then six years later became manager of Scotland.",It remains a game that Scotland cannot escape.

37573814,"The 17-year-old, who cannot be named, committed the offence while on a community payback order he received for having sex with a 12-year-old girl when he was 14.
A court heard that he had sex with the 13-year-old in the grounds of Dundee and Angus College.
The meeting was arranged on Snapchat.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard how the pair had met through mutual friends in 2015 but there was no contact between them until June 2016 when he added her on the social networking app.
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said that when they met they chatted for some time and the accused was immediately affectionate towards the girl, kissing and cuddling her.
""He told her he had been 'choking to go with her' and they then walked towards the college,"" Ms Robertson said.
""He repeatedly asked her if she would have sex with him, and when in the grounds of the college he said 'have sex with me there' and pointed to a grassy area.
""They went there and had sex, after which he stood up and said he had to leave.""
The girl's mother picked her up before the 13-year-old told her what had happened the next day.
She then told a counsellor who called in police.
The teenager was given a community payback order last year for his previous sex offence conviction.
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael told him that custody was the only option this time because he did not appear to have learned from his previous community sentence.
The 17-year-old pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act.
Defence solicitor Katrina Clark urged the court to impose a second community payback order instead of a jail term.
She said: ""He's aware he faces more time in custody.
""The more effective way forward for him would be through the intensive project outlined for him in the social work reports. That wouldn't be an easy option.
""This could be dealt with by a non-custodial sentence due to his age, the period he has spent in custody on remand and his acceptance of his guilt at an early stage.""
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael imposed a one-year sentence of detention on the teenager, placed him on the sex offenders register for 10 years and imposed a sexual offences prevention order for six years during which time he will be monitored by specialist police officers.
He said: ""Unfortunately from your perspective no other method than custody is appropriate.

19897695,"One of them, the blogger Prof Michael Pettis of the Beijing Business School, had earned kudos as one of the first to predict the sharp slowdown in China's economy seen over the last year.
The other was the Economist. The magazine, that is.
Their bet - for a bottle of booze - was over whether China's economy was about to run out of puff.
The country has managed 9.9% growth on average over the past 35 years, but Prof Pettis thinks that the growth rate will fall to a measly (by Chinese standards) 3% this decade.
The more gung-ho Economist by contrast was forecasting that China would stay on course to overtake the US as the world's biggest economy by 2018.
""China has grown very rapidly in the last 30 years, but it has been following a model that is not unique,"" says Prof Pettis.
""In the 50s and 60s almost everyone 'knew' that the Soviet Union would overtake the US in the 70s - even Jack Kennedy - but it didn't happen. Instead, the Russian economy got mired in debt and years of stagnation.""
Other examples include the Brazilian economic ""miracle"" of the 1960s and 1970s, says Prof Pettis, that ended in a 1982 financial crisis and a ""lost decade"" of growth, or Japan's rapid ascent up until its own 1990 crisis and subsequent two-decade stagnation.
What these countries have in common is an enormous level of government-led investment - in roads, trains, schools, hospitals, education and training.
""You can get tremendous growth by keeping investment levels high,"" he explains. ""And in the early days, growth is healthy and sustainable.
""But later... you very easily reach a point where you can't identify economically viable projects any more, and you overshoot and start misallocating capital in a pretty significant way. That's when debt rises more quickly than the economy's capacity to service it.""
China has been overinvesting perhaps since the 1990s, according to Prof Pettis, and certainly in the last five to 10 years.
""A lot of growth is fake,"" he says. ""If you spend $1bn building an airport, it generates the same amount of [economic output] today whether or not anyone actually uses the airport.
""If no-one uses it, however, the economic value created by the airport is not enough to repay the debt, and so future growth must decline as wealth is transferred from some other part of the economy to pay down the debt.""
He says that there are three main sources of growth for China. The first, investment, is already exhausted. The second, exports, are also no longer viable, as China's main export markets in Europe and the US are depressed, and China's trade surplus has become politically contentious in those countries.
The third option is for ordinary Chinese people to increase their spending on consumer products and services.
But here the numbers just don't stack up. Consumers account for just a third of spending in China - an unprecedentedly low share for any major economy - while investment accounts for a whopping half of the economy.
If investment just stagnates - and in developed capitalist economies it usually falls after such a long boom - then, with consumer spending starting from such a low base, China would have to pull off the biggest consumer spending boom in history just to maintain overall economic growth at the planned rate of 7%-8%.
But the kinds of policies that would be needed to pull this off - such as paying Chinese households more interest on their savings, paying Chinese workers higher wages at the cost of state-owned company profits, or providing Chinese migrant workers with decent social benefits - run up against powerful politically-connected interests.
Prof Pettis is doubtful that it can be done.
""The bet's still on,"" says Simon Cox, Asia economics editor at the Economist. ""Though it won't be resolved till the end of the decade.""
The Economist's side of the bet - that China will overtake the US by 2018 - was the default scenario in an interactive forecaster that they stuck on their website to let readers play God with the Chinese economy.
""[2018] seems quite soon, but then you look at the individual assumptions, and they don't seem too whacky.""
One crucial assumption is the exchange rate. Mr Cox's team expects the yuan to strengthen against the dollar, even while prices rise more quickly in China, meaning that measured in dollars China's economy could still grow very rapidly, even if in reality the country actually slows down.
""I agree with Pettis on a whole range of things. I think the investment rate is too high, and it is difficult to invest wisely when you are doing it so fast. A lot of investment, especially by state-owned companies, is inefficient.""
Where he parts company with the Beijing-based professor is on the question of whether China is running out of decent investment opportunities.
China is still a very underdeveloped country, and he says the capital stock per worker - the quantity of buildings, machinery, infrastructure, vehicles and suchlike relative to the population size - is still very low by Western or Japanese standards.
He also says that while Prof Pettis is focused on where spending will come from, what really matters for long-term growth is China's ability to improve skills and adopt new technology.
Will China fall flat on its face?
China's economic miracle
China businessmen's stories
""China is very good at absorbing knowhow from the rest of the world. It is much more open to foreign investment than Korea and Japan were. And it has a large domestic market, so foreign producers have an incentive to tutor local suppliers in their products.""
Mr Cox confesses to being an old-school Keynesian. As such, he believes that even if - as Prof Pettis believes - China does run into the same problem as the West, that ordinary citizens are not increasing their spending fast enough, the government can cope.
""If the alternative is unemployment, it is better to employ people to do something, even if it is not very value-adding.
""Lots of people are still living in old housing units left over from the 1990s, so it would be worthwhile employing people to build replacements for those. Unfortunately, a lot of labour instead gets wasted on building tasteless villas for the super-wealthy.
""China's economy is unfair and inefficient, but it's not unstable.""","Earlier this year, two economists made a friendly wager."
19867399,"The two firms should be barred from any US mergers and acquisitions, according to a House Intelligence Committee report.
The panel says the firms failed to allay fears about their association with China's government and military.
Huawei and ZTE denied the accusations in front of the panel in September.
On Monday ZTE issued a statement insisting its equipment met all US standards and posed no threat.
""ZTE has set an unprecedented standard for co-operation by any Chinese company with a congressional investigation,"" China's Xinhua news agency quoted the firm as saying.
How China became the US election bogeyman
Huawei's vice-president, William Plummer, said the latest accusations were ""dangerous political distractions"".
""Purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignores technical and commercial realities, recklessly threatens American jobs and innovation, does nothing to protect national security.""
While the House Intelligence report stopped short of calling for a boycott of the firms' mobile phone products, it was highly critical of the two companies.
""China has the means, opportunity and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,"" the report says.
""Based on available classified and unclassified information, Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems.""
The panel said their investigation had received credible allegations from current and former Huawei employees of bribery and corruption, discriminatory behaviour and copyright infringement.
Republican committee chairman Mike Rogers said they had passed on information to the FBI to investigate the allegations.
""We've come to the conclusion, unfortunately, they are not private entities,"" Mr Rogers said on Monday.
On Sunday, Mr Rogers delivered a blunt verdict to the 60 Minutes programme on US network CBS.
""If I were an American company today... and you are looking at Huawei, I would find another vendor if you care about your intellectual property, if you care about your consumers' privacy, and you care about the national security of the United States of America,"" he said.
Among the report's recommendations were to exclude any Huawei or ZTE equipment or component parts from being used by government contractors, as well both companies becoming ""more transparent and responsive to US legal obligations"".
China's Foreign Ministry urged the US to ""set aside prejudices"" regarding the two firms.
""Chinese telecoms companies have been developing their international business based on market economy principles,"" ministry spokesman Hong Lei said.
""Their investment in the United States embodies the mutually beneficial nature of Sino-American economic and trade relations.""
Huawei was started by Ren Zhengfei, a former member of the People's Liberation Army, in 1987.
As the firm has grown to become one of the largest global players in the sector, fears about its ties with the Chinese military have frequently surfaced.
There have been concerns and allegations that it was helping China gather information on foreign states and companies, charges that the firm has denied.
Last year, its purchase of American computer company 3Leaf systems, was rejected by a US security panel.
Earlier this year, it along with ZTE, faced allegations that some of their equipment had been installed with codes to relay sensitive information back to China.
Senior executives from the two companies denied those allegations when they appeared before US lawmakers in September.
ZTE is also facing accusations it sold US telecoms equipment to Iran, in breach of US sanctions. Telecoms giant Cisco on Monday ended its relationship with ZTE, Reuters reported, after its equipment was included in the Tehran deal.
This latest report comes in the midst of a US presidential campaign in which China has become a hot topic.
Both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney have pledged to increase the pressure on Beijing on issues ranging from China's currency policy to state subsidies for Chinese firms.
Earlier this month, Mr Obama signed an order blocking a deal by a Chinese firm, Ralls Corp, to acquire four wind farm projects near a US naval facility in Oregon.
It was the first foreign investment to be blocked in the US for 22 years.
The Chinese firm has since sued Mr Obama, alleging the US government overstepped its authority.","Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE pose a security threat to the US, a congressional panel has warned after an investigation into the two companies."
35419090,"Labour MP Yvette Cooper said it was not ""appropriate"" or ""statesmanlike"" for him to use such language about a ""complex and sensitive"" issue.
Shadow minister Kate Green said it was ""offensive, hurtful... and divisive"".
Mr Cameron said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had told the migrants at the camp ""they could all come to Britain"".
At the weekend, the Labour leader visited the Grande-Synthe Camp, near Dunkirk, and The Jungle in Calais, where more than 7,000 people are sleeping rough, describing conditions there as ""disgraceful"".
Jeremy Corbyn had a good go at David Cameron over the Google tax deal, using a crowd-sourced question from Jeff (or possibly Geoff), who wanted to know whether he could join a scheme allowing him to pay the same rate of tax as the internet giant.
But some commentators felt the Labour leader lost focus when he switched to other subjects for his final two questions.
""We've had no answer on Google, and no answers on Jeff,"" said Mr Corbyn, before turning to what he calls the ""bedroom tax"" and a High Court ruling that it is ""discriminatory"". For his final question, he called on the PM to launch an inquiry into arms export licences to Saudi Arabia amid UN reports of coalition air strikes on civilians in Yemen.
The prime minister responded to that last point by saying the UK had some of the strictest rules for arms exports in the world. He added that Britain was ""not part of Saudi-led operations"" in Yemen.
But it was one of those weeks when reaction to what was said at PMQs overshadowed anything that was said during the session, as Labour seized on Mr Cameron's ""bunch of migrants"" comment.
Mr Cameron was coming to the end of a clash with Jeremy Corbyn about Google's tax deal with the government, when he decided, as he often does, to broaden out his attack to other issues.
The Labour leader had just accused him of failing to stand up to Google.
Mr Cameron replied: ""The shadow chancellor's pointing - the idea that those two right honourable gentlemen would stand up to anyone in this regard is laughable.
""Look at the record over the last week - they met with the unions and they gave them flying pickets.
""They met with the Argentinians, they gave them the Falkland Islands.
""They met with a bunch of migrants in Calais, they said they could all come to Britain.
""The only people they never stand up for are the British people and hard-working taxpayers.""
Several Labour MPs objected to Mr Cameron's ""bunch of migrants"" comments on Twitter, describing them as ""shameful"" and ""inflammatory"" and the PM as ""odious"".
A Labour spokesman said Mr Cameron's use of the phrase ""demonstrates an attitude that is wholly unacceptable to a humanitarian crisis on our doorstep"".
Yvette Cooper, who is chairing Labour's refugee task force, said Mr Cameron should use ""much more statesmanship-like"" language on such a ""complex and sensitive"" issue, particularly given ongoing commemorations of Holocaust victims.
She got to her feet immediately after Prime Minister's Questions to raise a point of order
She asked Commons Speaker John Bercow to ask Mr Cameron to ""withdraw"" the comment.
Mr Bercow told Ms Cooper: ""You speak with enormous experience in this House and I respect what you say.
""I completely identify and empathise with your observations about Holocaust Memorial Day, which you and I on other occasions have marked at events together - so I take what you say extremely seriously.""
He ruled that it was not ""disorderly"" or ""un-Parliamentary"" but added ""people will make their own assessments of this matter"".
The prime minister's spokesman said the government had spent Â£1.2bn to help hundreds of thousands of refugees in camps in the region and he said Labour's approach would ""open the door and provide an incentive for more to come to Calais"".
Asked if he considered the phrase ""bunch of migrants"" to be pejorative the spokesman said ""the PM thinks that the key thing here is getting the policy right"".
Mr Cameron was accused by some opponents of using the ""bunch of migrants"" phrase to distract attention from criticism of the Google agreement.
But this was dismissed as ""silly and playing cheap politics"" by small business minister Anna Soubry
She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One Mr Cameron had been using the ""language of ordinary people"", adding ""we all use slang"" in the heat of the moment.
David Cameron insisted he has done more than any other prime minister to crack down on aggressive tax avoidance and blamed Labour for failures in collecting taxes from large multinationals.
Mr Corbyn claimed Google was paying an effective tax rate of 3% - and accused the government of sending out mixed messages, with Chancellor George Osborne initially describing the deal as a ""major success"" before No 10 rowed back, calling it a ""step forward"", while, he said, London mayor Boris Johnson labelled it ""derisory"".
Mr Cameron then went on to explain the measures the Government has put in place to tackle tax avoidance and evasion before claiming the tax rate for Google under Labour was ""0%"".
Mr Corbyn also pointed to a series of meetings Google had had with Government ministers.
""Millions of people are this week filling in their tax returns to get them in by the 31st,"" he said.
""They have to send the form back, they do not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is.
""Many people going to their HMRC offices or returning them online this week will say this - 'Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary, small businesses and self-employed workers?""'
Mr Cameron brushed off the criticism by launching into an attack on all the things Labour did not stand up to, including migrants.
Firstly: George Osborne risked sounded far too content when he hailed the deal as a ""victory"" and a ""major success"". Government spokesmen were reluctant to repeat his verdict.
Secondly: Labour reacted quickly and managed to get a hearing. Their message sounded louder than their internal disputes, for a change.
Thirdly: voters care. The perception international firms get a better deal than ordinary people is toxic.
HMRC collects tax, not ministers, and the government says it has acted and got results where Labour did not.
But few politicians ever caught the mood of a nation declaring themselves happy with a big business's tax return.
Mr Cameron began Prime Minister's Questions by announcing that a ""striking"" memorial to the victims of Nazi atrocities is to be erected beside Parliament, in Victoria Tower Gardens, where a number of monuments already stand.
Downing Street said an international design competition will be launched in the coming weeks and the memorial built by the end of 2017.
""It will stand beside Parliament as a permanent statement of our values as a nation and will be something for our children to visit for generations to come,"" Mr Cameron said.
""It is right that our whole country should stand together to remember the darkest hour of humanity.""
The SNP again challenged the prime minister to help those women born in the 1950s, affected by pension equalisation, with the party's leader at Westminster using both of his questions to press the point.
He called on David Cameron to respect a Parliamentary decision to immediately introduce transitional arrangements for those women negatively impacted (the vote was non-binding and does not compel ministers to act).
Mr Cameron did not address the point directly, but claimed the introduction of a single tier pension at Â£155 a week would end discrimination because ""so many women retiring will get so much more in their pension"".
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron is guaranteed one question at PMQs every month and he used his latest opportunity to urge the prime minister to do more to alleviate the refugee crisis facing Europe.
""The only way to challenge a crisis of that magnitude is by starting working with our European colleagues at the heart of a united Europe,"" he said.
He urged Mr Cameron to ""welcome in and provide a home"" to 3,000 unaccompanied children as recommended by campaigners.
In response, Mr Cameron said no country in Europe had been ""more generous"" in supporting refugee camps in the Middle East but the UK would not be taking part in the EU's refugee relocation and resettlement schemes as it was not in its national interest.","David Cameron is facing Labour calls to apologise for calling refugees at a camp in Calais ""a bunch of migrants"" at Prime Minister's Questions."

Mercedes were found to have gone beyond the degree permitted to help a driver solve a technical problem.
They broke a rule saying: ""The driver must drive the car alone and unaided.""
Mercedes have lodged an intention to appeal against the decision.
The Formula 1 rules were changed this year to introduce restrictions on how much teams can help drivers while they are out on track.
Teams are allowed to intervene if the car has a ""critical problem if a failure of a component or system is imminent and potentially terminal"".
Race stewards found Mercedes were allowed to give Rosberg instructions on the settings he needed to resolve the problem.
But they should not have responded to his subsequent question on whether he should then change gear so the car went straight through seventh gear.
Rosberg's engineer Tony Ross replied to the German's information that he had a gearbox problem with the words: ""Driver default 1-0-1, chassis default 0-1, chassis default 0-1. Avoid seventh gear, Nico, avoid seventh gear.""
Rosberg then asked: ""What does that mean, I have to shift through it?
Engineer: ""Affirm Nico, you need to shift through it. Affirm, you need to shift through it.""
Both Mercedes F1 team boss Toto Wolff and his opposite number at Red Bull, Christian Horner, questioned the need for the rules restricting driver assistance.
Horner said: ""The rule is rubbish. It doesn't make a great deal of sense. But the rules are the rules.
""The cars are technically very complex and you can understand why Mercedes would want to give that message to keep their driver running.
""It's a team sport and the cars are a lot more complicated than they were even four years ago for the drivers to work out what they should and shouldn't be doing.
""The question going forward is are these rules right for F1? That's a different question.""
Wolff, speaking before the decision to penalise Mercedes, drew parallels between this situation and one in last weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, when Force India did not tell their driver Sergio Perez that he had a critical brake problem and the Mexican crashed out on the final lap.
Wolff said: ""We see that those rules maybe need a re-think between the FIA and the teams to maybe go more into detail on what is allowed or not because not communicating at all, you might as well unplug the radio and throw it out of the car. It is part of driving since a long time.""
However, the rule is a pet project of FIA president Jean Todt and he has so far been deaf to questions about its suitability.

37486486,"Owen Creaney, from Lurgan, was found dead on 5 July 2014.
Shauneen Boyle, 25, and Stephen Thomas Hughes, 29, are jointly charged with his murder.
A friend of Ms Boyle's said she received a text on Friday 4 July which said Ms Boyle was ""in trouble"".
Mairead McGuigan told the jury at Belfast Crown Court that she later phoned Ms Boyle.
""She said she got into a fight with Owen, she had went mad, she had beat a fella up after getting into an argument and she jumped on his stomach and his head. She might have said that he was in a bad way,"" she said.
""She said there was blood all over his face. She said his face was busted open.''
Ms McGuigan said Ms Boyle phoned her about 21:00 and asked her to call round to Mr Hughes's house after work.
""She asked me to bring round my hoover and my carpet cleaner as she said there was a stain on the white carpet,'' she said
The witness said she called to Mr Hughes's house at Moyraverty Court, Craigavon, about 21:35 and told a prosecution barrister that she took a seat on the sofa in the living next to Ms Boyle while Mr Hughes remained standing in front of them.
""They were drinking. Shauneen said: 'I got into a fight with Owen Creaney over my dad',"" she Ms McGuigan said.
""Stephen said nothing. I asked him why he didn't break it up. He said he was afraid and said he had got his blinds broken.""
She told the court she was about to leave when she heard noises coming from upstairs and realised Mr Creaney was up there.
Ms Boyle told her he had been sleeping for 28 hours and was drunk after consuming alcohol.
Ms McGuigan followed the pair upstairs and saw Mr Creaney lying on a sofa.
""He was making funny breathing noises, like heavy breathing. Shauneen said he was sleeping. He was like bruised with yellow bruising. There was foam coming out of his mouth,"" she said.
""I told them to get the police, that this man has a broken rib. Shauneen said Stephen was afraid of the police coming to the house. I said he definitely has a broken rib and she said Owen had drank a litre of vodka and was lying sleeping.''
She told the court that the pair told her they had showered Mr Creaney following the fight to ""to try and bring him round"" and had changed him and washed his clothes.'
Ms McGuigan left the property and told a male friend what had happened.
She said she was in contact with Ms Boyle the following morning.
Ms McGuigan said she asked Ms Boyle about Mr Creaney, to which she replied: ""He is dead.'' I said: 'Get that man to the hospital now.''
""Shauneen said: 'It's too late. There is nothing more we can do for him'. But I don't think she was telling the truth.''
She said that during the phone call, she overheard a conversation between the pair talking about an ""empty wheelie bin"".

33066007,"These aren't real products, of course, but an art project poking fun at Asia's obsession with beauty and its propensity for conspicuous consumption.
The display was created by the inaugural cohort of Singapore-based graduates of the Glasgow School of Art, which set up its first overseas campus here in 2011.
The Scottish arts institution is looking to expand its course offerings over the next few years and aims to help develop the city-state's creative scene.
""We hope that we can use this platform and build relationships with other parts of the region using it as a hub,"" said its director, Tom Inns.
""To be an international art schools you've got to understand how the world works in terms of regions and different thinking and different cultures.
""It is only by being there that you can only really begin to understand that. You can't understand that from a distance.""
But if the experience of the last foreign creative arts school to open up in Singapore is anything to go by, there may be some challenges ahead.
This summer, the editing labs and sound engineering stations at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in Asia will fall silent for good.
The campus, set upon three-acres of prime property in central Singapore, is closing less than 10 years after opening due to millions of dollars of debts.
NYU still operates two degree-granting, liberal arts research university campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.
""Despite its significant creative success, the Tisch Asia campus failed to become financially sustainable,"" says a university statement.
John Beckman, vice president for public affairs at New York University said that reflecting back, they had ""learned a number of lessons"" from their experience.
""Academically and artistically, the Tisch Asia campus was a tremendous success,"" he said. ""But academic excellence is also expensive"".
""We were too optimistic about prospective enrolments both internationally and locally, the latter of which has been pivotal to many global academic initiatives.
""We operate on the principle that we will not direct money from the campus in New York to sustain global operations, we should have factored in a greater degree of support needed beyond tuition, especially in the critical start-up years.""
Mr Beckman added that Tisch Asia ""as a relatively small, independent graduate arts conservatory, was an ambitious enterprise"".
""The general lesson we learned was that it would have been better to have developed such a significant project as part of - and not separate from - our university-wide global efforts.""
The closure was not just a high-profile and expensive failure for the school, but for the Singapore government, which had invited them to set up here in 2007.
However, Tisch Asia is not alone.
In recent years, Australia's University of New South Wales, the University of Las Vegas Nevada and Warwick University have all exited, mostly due to financial reasons.
Singapore used to publicise its aim of becoming a global education hub, saying it hoped the sector would ultimately contribute up to 5% of its gross domestic product (GDP).
More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch
The Economic Development Board (EDB), which seeks to bring investments to Singapore, launched the ""Global Schoolhouse"" project in 2002.
The scheme saw it offer millions of dollars in grants and subsidies to attract top names here. In many ways, it has been quite a success.
French business school INSEAD has been operating its satellite campus. American Ivy League university Yale also launched here, despite some controversy.
But following the high-profile failure of Tisch Asia and other foreign universities, it seems the government has changed its tune about attracting more entrants.
Alvin Tan, the EDB's assistant managing director of corporate development, says that in recent years the local higher education provision has increased in ""diversity and quality"" and he talks of any future incoming institutions as being a ""complement"" to strong local options.
A university's future in Singapore doesn't only come down to financial considerations, however.
The University of Chicago's Booth School of Business decided to relocate its campus from Singapore to Hong Kong in order to be situated closer to the China market.
William Kooser, the associate dean of global outreach at the University of Chicago said their lease in Singapore was expiring this year and that their strategy came up for review.
""There are a couple of things that schools need to understand before they decide to go overseas,"" said Mr Kooser.
""One is that it's not easy. It is not simply a matter of duplicating what you do in the United States and plopping it into another city.
""Two, you need to understand what it is you are trying to get out of the programme. Is it simply trying to create revenue? Or is it something beyond that?
""If it is simply to create revenue, if you don't to meet your revenue targets, it's easy to pull out. If you are trying to achieve something else you are typically in it for the longer haul.""
Singapore is regularly cited for its high quality of life, political stability, low-tax environment and ease of doing business.
However, the city-state's rising cost of living has led to major issues for both foreign universities and students.
It is the most expensive country in the world, according to an annual survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
Singapore's booming property prices and strong currency has also translated into high rent and tuition fees.
Then there is the question of getting a job after graduation.
Singapore's labour market has tightened over the last few years, making it harder for foreigners to get job here.
One year after the Glasgow School of Art's first graduation ceremony, another group of students are preparing their final year projects.
It is a sweltering hot day and they are on campus despite it being a school holiday, listening to pop music while painting large wooden panels. Their enthusiasm is clear.
But like so many students at Tisch, the future of their campus may ultimately come down to dollars and cents.","On the shelves of ""Happy Mart,"" there are gleaming cans of ""instant nose jobs"", packets of ""Same Face"" cookies and boxes of ""Luxurios"" cereal."
36634782,"Baroness Morgan said Labour is in a serious situation if it cannot reconnect with working class communities.
She said there ""probably was an element"" of Labour's Remain campaign starting too late.
""A lot of us were exhausted"", she told BBC Radio Wales.

Asked if Labour's Remain campaign started too late, she told the Eye on Wales programme: ""I think there probably was an element of that.
""And don't forget in Wales we had the assembly elections where people were not talking about the European Union. We were focused absolutely on those assembly elections.""
She added: ""I think it was a mistake not to be talking about the European referendum in those assembly elections.""
Wales voted 52.5% to 47.5% for Brexit. Only five counting areas voted to Remain.
The strongest Leave votes were in Torfaen (60%) and Blaenau Gwent (62%) - two traditional Labour strongholds in the south Wales valleys.
The Welsh government has a programme to ""re-energise"" communities that voted to Leave, much of which would have been funded by EU money, Baroness Morgan said.
""The question for us now is how on Earth do we reorganise the economy without that European funding?"" she asked.
""Unless we find a way to reconnect with that working class element within our communities then I think the Labour party is in a serious situation in future"".
Labour won 29 seats at May's assembly election - a better result than many expected - but lost 7.6% of its share of the vote on the constituency ballot.
Earlier, on BBC Sunday Politics Wales, Baroness Morgan said Carwyn Jones was ""absolutely, without question"" the right man to lead Welsh Labour.","It was a mistake for Labour to avoid talking about the EU referendum during the assembly election campaign, one of the party's AMs has said."

The archbishop was referring to the impact of government-led programmes in several dozen villages in the region which focus on delaying marriage.
In this area, the lure of a bride price causes many families to push for early weddings. But there is another reason.
""Fear of abduction is also a factor,"" said Alemseged Weldegerima from the Ethiopian government's Bureau of Women, Children and Youth Affairs.

Beside a small eucalyptus plantation Archbishop Tutu was sharing a low wooden bench with two Elders who have broken the mould; the first woman to be president of Ireland, Mary Robinson, and the former prime minister of Norway, and ex-head of the World Health Organization, Gro Brundtland.

""So what job do you want to do?"" I asked.
""Prime minister,"" she replied without hesitation.  Look out Meles Zenawi!
Abay has joined a girls' club known as Berhane Hewan - Amharic for ""Light for Eve"".
She has learnt about issues which have prepared her to resist early marriage; personal health, HIV/Aids, and the medical complications associated with giving birth at a young age, like fistula.
Female circumcision is also discussed and in the 36 villages where the clubs have been set up, I am told fewer girls are now getting cut.
Beside the road several boys are playing table football. They seem to welcome the idea of delaying marriage.
""You can't afford to run a family when you're too young,"" said 20-year-old Tazab, who has no plans to wed any time soon.
""Also it's bad for a girl's health to have children too early,"" he says.
In a rectangular mud-walled building which serves as a meeting hall and classroom for the Berhane Hewan participants, I met 15-year-old Serkaddis Assefa.
""Because of the Berhane Hewan programme I know about the issue of early marriage. If I hadn't joined, I might have been married off already,"" she said.
Sitting alongside was her mother, Enguday Assefa, whose forth child was fast asleep on her back.
Around Ms Enguday's neck was part of her dowry payment; a coin bearing the face of Ethiopia's last emperor, Haile Selassie, and another of Queen Taitu, wife of the monarch Menelik II who died in 1913.
""I still feel bad when I think about my friends who now have jobs and have reached different positions,"" said Ms Enguday, who was forced to quit school and was already married with a child by the age of  15.
For the Elders, the behavioural change which has only happened in the last five years is worth celebrating.
""When Nelson Mandela brought us together at our first planning meeting he did say to us: 'Be bold, talk to those whom others won't talk to, be on the side of the most deprived, the most isolated, the most undervalued in society,'"" recalls Mrs Robinson.
""And in many ways those young girls, brides and mothers are very undervalued by their community and have very little sense of self-worth so the issue of child marriage, as far as I'm concerned, is a very good way of having an entry point into the effect of poverty.
""The effect of a lack of equality within communities, the effect of harmful traditional practices on the community - the effect of all the things that the Elders should be championing.""
Berhane Hewan started off with 700 girls and at its peak reached around 12,000 - just a small fraction of the vulnerable population.
While considered to be a successful initiative, the programme will need to be scaled up significantly to make a major difference in Ethiopia.
For the first time the girls here are starting to shape their own destinies.
The hope among the Elders is that lessons from Ethiopia's Amhara Region can be applied to other parts of the world where child marriage is common, like India.","""I wanted to get an education but my parents were determined to marry me off,"" says Himanot Yehewala, an Ethiopian girl who was married five years ago at the age of 13."

""There is no gender because you can be a he or she... That's their culture. It does not apply to us. We are Catholics and there is the Civil Code, which says that you can only marry a woman for me... a woman to marry a man.
""That's our law so why would you accept that gender?"" he said.
""Wherever God placed you, just remain there. Do not mix it upâ€¦ You erase the great divide between a woman and a man,"" he added.
Before becoming president in June 2016, Mr Duterte was the mayor of Davao city, which introduced anti-discrimination laws for sex, gender and sexual orientation during his administration.
In 2015, Mr Duterte appeared on a national talk show where he said same-sex marriage was ""good... everyone deserves to be happy"".
The following year, while campaigning for the presidency, he said he would ""consider"" legalising same-sex marriage if there was such a proposal.
The Philippines has 80 million Catholics and remains a deeply religious society.
Mr Duterte has taken issue with the church previously, once calling the Pope a ""son of a whore"".
Despite his many controversial comments he still remains highly popular in the Philippines.","Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has said he opposes gay marriage, after previously declaring he would consider legalising it."

37604054,"Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool would have drawn level on points with leaders Manchester City with a fifth successive Premier League victory, but were subdued by a classic Jose Mourinho performance of defensive organisation and discipline.
United did not allow Liverpool to build the momentum and intensity that has characterised their game this season, while Mourinho's limited attacking ambitions ensured chances were at a premium.
The Portuguese was still grateful for two fine second-half saves from goalkeeper David de Gea, who dived low to stop Emre Can and saved athletically from Philippe Coutinho's 25-yard effort.
United's best chance also came in the second half, but the unmarked Zlatan Ibrahimovic directed Paul Pogba's cross off target.
The visitors had just 35% of possession - their lowest in a Premier League match since Opta began recording the data in 2003-04.

While this deadlock does little for the ambitions of both teams, there is no doubt who will be the happier manager.
This was, in so many respects, the most Mourinho performance of his short time at United.
Klopp came on to the pitch at the final whistle to applaud Liverpool's fans, but there was a tinge of disappointment in his measured tread as he trudged off.
His side's promising start to the season has been built on pressing opponents into submission - a high-pressure style that has brought victories at Arsenal and Chelsea, as well as nine goals in two home wins against Leicester City and Hull City.
But Mourinho picked a powerful, athletic side and instructed them to turn the tables on Liverpool's pressing game.
Ander Herrera was at the heart of United's smothering gameplan, almost operating in the pockets of Coutinho and Roberto Firmino in midfield, while Liverpool were never given a second.
They simply could not find a way through.
United held their shape and discipline, much to their manager's satisfaction, although he still needed those two superb saves from De Gea, and a magnificent saving tackle from Antonio Valencia to stop Firmino as he raced in on goal.
It was classic Mourinho, a tactic he has perfected and utilised throughout his career, and Anfield's increasing anger and frustration will have been music to his ears.
This match should have been the perfect stage for the £89m Pogba - but once again he was a peripheral figure.
The world's most expensive player was used in a more advanced role and is certainly on the same wavelength as Ibrahimovic, delivering a perfect cross which the Swede should have converted.
In other aspects, though, he operated on the margins of the game and failed to exert the influence expected of a player of his quality and experience.
United will expect much more as the season goes on.
Anthony Taylor was the man in the middle in every sense after the heat generated by the appointment of the Manchester-based official for a meeting between these two fierce rivals.
Mourinho said the appointment made it ""difficult"" for Taylor, and put him under pressure - comments being investigated by the Football Association - while former referee Keith Hackett even suggested it represented a risk to his and his family's safety.
It certainly increased the scrutiny on Taylor, who felt the wrath of The Kop within minutes - complete with colourful reminders about his place of residence - when he did not book Marcus Rashford for a foul on James Milner.
It was to the official's credit that he did not buckle in the atmosphere, kept discipline without resorting to a rash of yellow cards, and controlled a game that always has explosive potential.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: ""I am not frustrated but I am not happy with the performance. No-one will show this game in 10 or 20 years but we could have played better.
""It was a hectic game, interrupted here and there, but we lost patience with our passing game. The attitude of my team was really good. We were ready to fight but when you can play better, you have to.
""The kind of defence is difficult to play. The man-marking is really difficult, they are stronger than us. We wasted energy in the first half for nothing. The second half was better and with fresher legs in second half we could have created more.""
Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho: ""It is not the result we wanted but it is a positive result. It is a result that stops a direct opponent getting three points at home, so not a bad result.
""The game was difficult for both teams but for longer periods it was more difficult for them than us.
""We controlled the game not just tactically but the emotion of the game. That was probably the quietest Anfield I had and I was expecting it to be the other way.
""It was a positive performance.""

New standards were introduced by the Welsh government over a year ago aimed at ensuring equal access to healthcare.
But the report says little progress has been made.
Richard Williams, director of Action on Hearing Loss Cymru said the charities that authored the report are ""really concerned"" that people are leaving surgeries and hospitals unclear about what doctors have told them, what medication they need or whether operations have been successful.
New standards were brought in after a BBC Wales investigation in 2013 found health boards were breaching equality laws by not providing accessible services for the deaf and hard of hearing.
But 91 per cent of people surveyed for the report said they were not aware of improvements in the way healthcare providers communicate and share information with them.
Kay Coleman from Swansea began losing her hearing 15 years ago and said she finds it ""incredibly difficult"" to book a doctor's appointment.
An estimated 500,000 people are affected by hearing loss and 100,000 are living with sight loss in Wales.

22423362,"The 48-year-old man suffered a suspected heart attack five minutes into the second half of Kilmarnock's home match against Hibernian.
Paramedics and medical staff from both clubs treated the man until an ambulance arrived at Rugby Park stadium and he was taken to a nearby hospital.
Both managers agreed to abandon the match out of respect for the fan.
The stadium was hushed into silence when medical staff and club doctors attended the stricken fan in the west stand.
The referee then stopped the match with the teams drawing 1-1. Players left the pitch as the gravity of the situation became evident.
Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnston said: ""The length of time the players were off the park was a problem but the overriding factor was respect for the fan and his family.
""He collapsed and was tended to by medical staff of both clubs and was taken to Crosshouse Hospital by ambulance.""
He added that he could not reveal any more information about the fan's identity other than to say he was a long-standing season-ticket holder

38148520,"Pensions currently rise by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.
There have been warnings over the cost of the lock, and the government says it will review it after 2020.
Shadow Treasury minister Rebecca Long-Bailey said this caused ""uncertainty and worry"", pledging to protect it ""throughout the lifetime of the next Parliament"", due to end in 2025.
Speaking during Treasury questions in the Commons, Chancellor Philip Hammond said it was responsible for the government to decide which commitments it can afford to keep at a spending review before the end of Parliament.
Attacking Labour's pledge, he added: ""I think it tells us everything we need to know about the Opposition - that three-and-a-half years out they're willing to spray around commitments without any idea of what it's going to cost them.""
During last week's Autumn Statement Mr Hammond said the triple lock would be maintained until 2020 but suggested it would then be reviewed.
There have been calls for it to be scrapped, including from former pensions minister Baroness Altmann, who said the costs would become ""enormous"" after 2020, and the previous work and pensions secretary, Stephen Crabb.
Speaking after Treasury Questions, shadow chancellor John McDonnell accused the Conservatives of ""abandoning older people"" by not guaranteeing to continue the pledge.
He added: ""Labour will support the pensions triple lock and instead of cutting taxes for the super-rich and giant corporations will make sure our NHS and social care is properly funded.""","Labour says it will keep the ""triple lock"" protecting the state pension throughout the next Parliament."
21615080,"The proposals are the brain child of Swiss businessman turned politician Thomas Minder, who runs a small family company producing natural cosmetics.
Mr Minder wants shareholders to have a veto over managers' salaries, and to ban golden handshakes altogether.
The ""fat cat initiative"", as it has come to be called, would, if approved, be written into the Swiss constitution, and would apply to all Swiss companies listed on Switzerland's stock exchange.
Mr Minder, an outspoken man, says the culture of high salaries and high bonuses in Switzerland has got out of hand, pointing to the fact that huge sums have been paid out even when the companies concerned were doing badly.
The bankruptcy of national icon Swissair back in 2001, and the subsequent huge payoffs to its failed boss Mario Corti, were the catalyst to Mr Minder's decision to act.
""That really stuck in my throat,"" he told Swiss television. ""It made me absolutely furious.
""I'm still furious today, to think that a chief executive like Mr Corti could get five years' salary to go. I mean, the company was in a disastrous situation. At the end he wasn't even paying its bills. Swissair went bankrupt. The company doesn't exist anymore.""
Salaries for Swiss top managers are higher than most and their taxes are lower.
These two things alone would not necessarily anger most voters, however.
What has attracted support for Mr Minder's initiative has been a series of perceived disasters for major Swiss companies, coupled with salaries and bonuses staying high.
The main example is banking giant UBS, which wrote off billions in the wake of the 2007 sub-prime mortgage crisis, and then had to be bailed out by the Swiss government.
After that, the bank lost more billions because of a rogue trader, and announced thousands of redundancies.
But high salaries and bonuses for the bank's top managers continued throughout.
""The fat cats are getting fattest in the banks,"" says Edouard Dommen of the Swiss shareholders group Actares.
""The other companies are getting fat, but not quite so grossly.""
Mr Dommen, who supports the new measures, believes voters are especially angry about UBS, because their own tax money had to be spent to bail out the bank.
""People are fed up,"" he says. ""They know that this is at their expense.
""Small people had to dig into their own pockets to bail out these banks, and then see people, some of whom turned out to be literally crooks, walk off with their money, so of course they are angry.""
If passed, the measures would give Switzerland some of the strictest laws on executive pay in the world, far tougher than the limit on bonuses just approved by the European Union.
Both the Swiss government and Swiss business leaders have been campaigning against the measures.
The government says it understands that voters want some control over high salaries and has offered a milder alternative, but so far this seems to have attracted little interest.
Meanwhile the Swiss Business Association has been arguing that the measures would undermine Switzerland's ability to compete.
""Certainly, it will damage our competitiveness,"" says the association's deputy head of competition and regulation, Meinrad Vetter. ""We are against this initiative because it violates Switzerland as a business location.
""It's not good if the corporation law is too strict and too rigid in comparison to other countries, and with this initiative we will be an island in corporate governance all over the world.""
Business leaders have argued that some of Switzerland's biggest companies might simply leave, if they were unable to attract top quality managers because they were not allowed to pay them what they wanted.
For the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, such a move might actually be quite easy.
The company's current headquarters is in Basel, within sight of both the German and French borders.
Concerns over loss of competitiveness, and fears that Swiss companies might emigrate, did at first seem to be striking a chord with voters.
But one event, caused ironically by Novartis itself, seems to have changed a lot of minds.
In February of this year it was announced that Novartis' outgoing chairman Daniel Vasella would be receiving a 72m Swiss francs (Â£51m; $78m) ""non-compete"" pay off over six years, designed to stop him working for other related industries.
There was amazement and anger in Switzerland. Mr Vasella's salary had been regarded by many as excessively high for some time. Meanwhile, Novartis had been cutting jobs.
""I thought this was absolutely astonishing,"" says Mr Dommen, a man who doesn't mince his words.
""He is an idiot. I say he's an idiot because given this vote is coming up, to do something so grossly provocative at that moment just guaranteed that the opposition was going to win.""
The payment was scrapped in response to protests.
And indeed, the latest opinion polls seem to reflect that, showing that 64% of voters will say yes to the ""fat cat initiative"".
Mr Dommen does not believe a yes vote will isolate Switzerland.
Instead, he says, it would bring his country into line with public opinion across Europe.
""Times are changing throughout Europe,"" he says.
""The period when people could get away with these enormous salaries is going out of fashion.
""In Switzerland we are not on a different planet - it's going out of fashion here too. Most Swiss voters think something has to change.""
Opinion polls have been wrong in the past, of course, but all the signs are that on Sunday, Switzerland's fat cats will have to start tightening their belts.",Switzerland's voters go to the polls to decide on controversial proposals which would impose strict limits on the salaries awarded to top executives.

The 50 clerics, part of the little-known Tanzeem Ittehad-i-Ummat body based in Lahore, also said any act intended to ""humiliate, insult or tease"" transgender individuals should be considered a crime under Islam.
The fatwa is not legally binding in any way.
""We are glad that somebody's talked about us too,"" transgender rights worker Almas Bobby told BBC Urdu. ""By Sharia we already had the right [to marry], but unless measures are taken to remove the misconceptions about us in society, the condition of our community will not be changed.""
Another social worker for gender issues told BBC Urdu that it was a ""good step"", but that issues would remain until transgender marriage was officially legitimised.
Qamar Nasim said that many police officers had charged people in transgender marriages because ""due to a lack of knowledge... they consider it same-sex marriage"".
""This practice can only be stopped when [the] government spread awareness about rights of a transgender person.""
Transgender people are discriminated against in Pakistan and struggle to find employment.
More than 45 transgender people have been killed in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the past two years, according to local rights group Trans Action.
Last month, a 23-year-old transgender activist died after delays in treatment. Alisha, who was shot eight times, was in critical condition when admitted to hospital but staff could not decide whether to put her in a male or female ward, according to her friends.
Trans Action, an advocacy group, say that there are at least 45,000 transgender people in the province and at least half-a-million nationwide.
In 2012, Pakistan's Supreme Court declared equal rights for transgender citizens, including the right to inherit property and assets. They were also given the right to vote the year before.
However, it has denied homosexual couples the permission to marry, with cases in the past of male homosexuals being charged under anti-sodomy laws.","A religious decree declaring transgender marriage to be legal has been cautiously welcomed in Pakistan, but activists say attitudes still need to change."

""Microsoft and Intel are certainly pushing the two-in-one device strategy [in which laptops transform into tablets], which could result in some sales,"" said Michael Silver from the tech consultancy Gartner.
""But it's not only the fact that the upgrade is free, but Windows 10 for PCs is designed to run on computers that ran Windows 7 and even do better on less powerful hardware, so it will not spur on sales to the same extent as we've seen in the past.""","Microsoft's next generation of its operating system, Windows 10, is due to be released next month."
37836739,"Ildar Dadin is serving two and a half years for a series of street protests.
He told his lawyer that he had been strung up by his handcuffed wrists, had his head shoved down a toilet and been threatened with rape and death.
Russia's prison service says the claims are untrue but will investigate if the activist complains formally.
Unusually, the allegations made the headlines on state-controlled television on Tuesday after Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the case merited ""the closest attention"" and that President Vladimir Putin would be informed.
Dadin's supporters gathered outside the justice ministry on Tuesday evening in protest.
Ildar Dadin, 34, says his problems began after he was transferred to Prison Number Seven in the Karelia region of north-western Russia in mid-September and sent directly to a punishment cell.
More on this story:
Now out of isolation, Dadin has dictated a letter to his wife via his lawyer, in which he says he was beaten and kicked repeatedly by up to a dozen prison staff.
One day, he alleges, he was hung from his wrists for about half an hour causing ""extreme pain"".
""They then took off my pants and said that they would bring in another prisoner who would rape me if I didn't agree to end my hunger strike,"" Ildar Dadin writes.
He had stopped eating in protest at being held in a punishment cell.
Russia's FSIN prison service told the BBC that Mr Dadin was put in isolation for what a spokeswoman called ""violations of the detention regime"", but insisted that his claims of beating and torture were false.
""There's no way illegal methods were used, especially for such a well-known character,"" Kristina Belousova told the BBC by telephone.
""It's not the first time we've seen this, by people trying to attract maximum attention,"" the spokeswoman added.
Ildar Dadin was sentenced in December 2015, under Article 212.1 - a controversial law that makes repeat violations of Russia's strict laws on street protests a criminal offence.
""We didn't expect this to happen. It's awful,"" lawyer Alexei Liptser told the BBC, after visiting his client on Monday and transcribing his account.
""He is frightened and subdued,"" the lawyer added.
As the allegations of abuse spread on social media, and reached the Kremlin, Russia's human rights ombudswoman ordered a regional representative to visit the prison and said she was taking the case under her ""personal control"".

35300113,"Coatbridge College head John Doyle was given the money after his institution merged with two other colleges.
Holyrood's public audit committee, which said the principal was paid ""in excess of the guidelines"", has passed its report to Police Scotland.
Mr Doyle told MSPs in October he had done nothing wrong and that his reputation had been unfairly ""trashed"".
In June, the Auditor General Caroline Gardner issued a highly-critical report of the severance deals paid out by Coatbridge College, which she said were overly-generous.
She claimed Mr Doyle and chairman of the former college - John Gray - had colluded in order to ""achieve a certain outcome"" by withholding important information from the remuneration committee.
The report by the Scottish Parliament's audit committee agreed with the auditor general.
Mr Doyle, who earned £116,000 a year by the end of his service, was given:
Six other college staff also benefited from the £850,000 pot of pay-off money.
Police Scotland said that officers had had discussions with Audit Scotland and the ""matter is under review"".
Following the report, the Scottish government said it would ""carefully consider its [the report's] recommendations in the coming days"".
Committee convener Paul Martin said: ""There is a compelling moral argument for John Doyle to repay the tens of thousands of pounds extra he received from the college.
""The Scottish government provided more than £52m between 2011/12 and 2013/14 to support the college merger process and most of that money was used to fund voluntary severance schemes.
""It was not provided however to allow already highly-paid public servants to feather their own nests at the expense of their colleagues and of their students' education.""
The report made key recommendations, including;
A Scottish government spokeswoman said the way in which ""decisions involving hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money were made at Coatbridge College were completely unacceptable"".
She added: ""The events in question took place before April 2014 when colleges were reclassified by ONS and stronger financial controls came into effect.""
By Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland political correspondent
MSPs on Holyrood's public audit committee were unanimous.
Their report into bumper pay-offs for Coatbridge college bosses finds that the principal, John Doyle, was responsible for ""serious failings in the governance of severance arrangements"".
It says he colluded with the chairman, John Gray to secure ""excessive"" pay-offs for himself and six other senior managers by deliberately withholding information from those who signed off the deals.
The committee is urging Mr Doyle to pay back much of his £304,000 golden goodbye.
They say this request and their decision to copy their report to Police Scotland are without precedent.
Mr Doyle has previously refused to pay back any money arguing that he has ""done nothing wrong"". Mr Gray has also denied collusion.
The committee convenor, Paul Martin, says in these circumstances the charity regulator or the Scottish Funding Council should think creatively about how they could force a clawback.
The difficulty with these demands is that what MSPs find morally questionable may prove to be contractually correct.","A former college principal should hand back some of his £304,000 severance pay, a committee of MSPs has concluded."

If the former Nottingham Forest and Derby County defender had access to the sort of help and support he is now eager to offer young footballers, he may well have achieved a great deal more.
Now retraining as a counsellor, Charles - still best remembered for his innocent part in the infamous tackle that almost ended Paul Gascoigne's career - is determined to give something back to the sport that gave him so much.
His journey has been far from smooth, with the low point a six-month prison sentence for dangerous driving and failing to give a breath sample that was brought about by his drinking.
Following his time in the East Midlands Charles, who won two England caps, was forced to retire at the age of 32 after injury-plagued spells with Aston Villa, Benfica and West Ham. It was the injuries that led to the boozing.
""While I was playing I was disciplined,"" Charles told BBC Inside Out. ""As soon as I was injured - if it was for any length of time - I would maybe go out a little bit more than I would normally. But it wouldn't be all the time.
""I am the first to admit that I have had my issues with drinking and I am a recovering alcoholic. But my drinking was very different from someone drinking every day. It wasn't all the time, it would be the odd time that would last two or three days.
""I wasn't a typical alcoholic. I could stop and go long periods of time without drinking.
""But toward the end of my football career it would last a little bit longer - definitely. As soon as I was nearly back to full fitness, I would go back in to my disciplined life again.""

Charles has been sober for nine years. The 45-year-old is director of football at Nottingham University and is working with Priority Health - a specialist organisation to help young footballers.
And he really wants to help.
""If a lot more people were more honest and there wasn't such a stigma around alcoholics or drug addicts then a lot of people would benefit from it,"" Charles said.
""We need to encourage young players not to live with addictions and talk to people.
""I know it is hard for a young player to go to a coach or an assistant manager and say 'listen I am struggling with drinking' or gambling or whatever because they do think it could be detrimental to their careers and maybe they will not get the contract of their dreams.
""There are things away from football clubs and there are people you can speak to.
""I want people to know that if you are struggling with addiction, speak to somebody about it because it does help. You don't have to go through hell when you can address your issues a lot earlier and go on and live a normal life.""
His time in prison was the real end of his ""normal life"" and helped set him on the way to sobriety. Charles was struggling to deal with the end of his career and it was at this point that he realised things needed to change.
""Prison was definitely something that opened my eyes to being somewhere I didn't want to continue going,"" Charles said.
""I just didn't want to drink any more or feel the way I was feeling any more. I had just had enough.
""Football is very much a closed shop but I think it is something that needs to be talked about. Addiction does not pick a certain type.""
Football life for London-born Charles began brilliantly as a youngster forcing his way in to Brian Clough's Forest side at the end of the 1980s.
""It's a big thing when you actually come in to a club and you are here every day and are watching the first team play,"" Charles said.
""The Forest team had a lot of great players at the time. I still remember cleaning the boots of Johnny Metgod, Garry Birtles, Gary Mills and Gary Fleming; they were the four players I looked after.
""That was one of the biggest things I enjoyed because I got to go in to the first team dressing room and listen to what they spoke about.""
Despite all Charles achieved, it was his part in the Gazza story that still triggers the memory banks when his name crops up.
Forest reached the 1991 FA Cup final where they played a Tottenham side featuring Gascoigne and Gary Lineker.
Despite going ahead through a trademark Stuart Pearce free-kick, Brian Clough's Forest lost a thrilling match 2-1.
But the game - enthralling as it was - was overshadowed by two moments of Gazza madness. His first challenge on Garry Parker saw Gascoigne plant his foot in the Forest midfielder's chest, the second saw the Lazio-bound superstar rupture a cruciate ligament in his right knee because of his ugly lunge on Charles.
""I remember the tackle on Parks,"" Charles said. ""I thought that was worse than my one to be honest. It was just a mis-timed tackle. It is something that every professional footballer has done.
""I didn't think much of it. I know a lot was made of it but I was more disappointed with us losing the game. If you speak to a lot of the Forest lads that is one of our biggest regrets. It was a massive day for the club.""
Charles wants to ensure the young footballers he comes into contact with will only have reason to regret matters on the pitch.

Newtownards Magistrates' court heard he allegedly confessed to his social worker that he got a dog which was ""free to a good home"" from a website.
He then strangled it with its own lead, ""skinned it and fed it to his other dog"".
A police officer told the court that as well as the alleged confession to his social worker, ""traces of dog fur were found in the fire"".
She said there were strong objections to Mr Mocsari being freed on bail as he is considered a danger to the public.
The defendant appeared in court via video link from Maghaberry prison.

The virus could have spread even further had a cyber security researcher not accidently discovered a ""kill switch"" in the malicious program.
He was assisted by a researcher from security firm Proofpoint, which has an office in Belfast.
There is no shortage of cyber security experts in Northern Ireland - the industry now employs about 1,200 people.
And there is such a demand for their expertise, they can earn twice the average salary in Northern Ireland.
Invest NI - the region's business development agency - says Northern Ireland is the number one location in the world for cyber security inward investment and the number one global destination for US cyber security companies with an eye for international expansion.
Invest NI said companies had been enticed by the ""hard-to-find"" skillsets being nurtured at Queen's and Ulster University.
""Companies such as Black Duck, Rapid 7, Proofpoint, Alert Logic and Whitehat are recent investors here,"" said a spokeswoman.
""And with Symantec, a security software vendor, predicting the number of job openings to rise to 6m globally by 2019, there are real opportunities for our talented workforce.""
Emily McDaid writes about all things tech and edits the Techwatch blog for Catalyst Inc Connect, a not-for-profit network that runs a number of programmes to help innovation companies get off the ground or grow.
Northern Ireland has a booming tech sector, she said, particularly in the fields of cyber security, data analytics, fintech (software for the financial sector) and blockchain - the technology underpinning the digital currency Bitcoin.
""London is no longer the go-to place,"" she said. ""Northern Ireland is a cheaper place to live and do business. And if the corporation tax was to be lowered, that would be massive for the sector.""
Cyber security has become big business for corporate firms and start-ups in Northern Ireland, she said, and they are in the unique position of working in both the Irish and UK markets.
She has written about a start-up in Belfast, one of only two companies in the world, which uses a person's heartbeat as a way of identification, as opposed to fingerprints or retinal scan.
Then there are the two female cryptography experts looking at how to keep data safe when quantum computing becomes a reality - quantum computers will be so clever they will be able to break security algorithms easily, and hack data in seconds.
In addition to working with at least 500 entrepreneurs each year, Mrs McDaid's organisation inspires young people to pursue careers in tech and innovation.
""Cyber security is so big at the moment, it has an 0% unemployment rate,"" added Mrs McDaid.
""The more NI becomes a recognised centre of innovation, the more you will get the talent coming up through the generations.""
Last week, two international conferences were held in Belfast on the issue of cyber security - it is a burgeoning industry because with every technological advance comes a new opportunity for criminals to exploit it.
One of the conferences was hosted by the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT), based at the Northern Ireland Science Park in Belfast's Titanic Quarter.
CSIT, which is part of Queen's University Belfast, is home to the UK's largest cyber-security research cluster.
David Crozier, head of strategic partnerships and engagement at the major research hub, says it has a ""critical mass of researchers"" looking at malware, network security, encryption and critical infrastructure.
He said the centre had acted as a magnet for companies, attracted by the research and skilled workforce.
While it is a global export-based business, with most firms working for multi-nationals, the industry is a significant contributor to the economy, says Mr Crozier.
""The skills are so in demand at the moment that the industry is on course to generate salaries of £60m per annum,"" he said.
""For those citizens with the knowledge, they are able to earn about £42,500 per year - the average salary here is about £23,000.""
Northern Ireland as a whole also wins because it means some of the world's foremost cyber-security experts are living here.
""Citizens not working in the industry will benefit from the expertise and all the work that is going on to ensure government and public service systems are resilient and secure,"" said Mr Crozier.
""They can never be 100% secure and breaches are a daily occurrence, even for big companies, but more often than not, networks will be protected.""
Mr Crozier is part of a working group, which includes the police and various government departments.
Since last year, it has been operating as the NI Cyber Security Framework for Action and its aim is to ensure a co-ordinated approach to cyber security.
The group has formulated a set of priorities and while the political deadlock at Stormont means they are still unpublished, Mr Crozier says the work is certainly not on hold.
""The man on the street doesn't want to think about cyber security,"" he added.
""But the public needs to know there are people working behind the scenes to protect networks and keep ahead of attackers.
""They are unsung heroes and they only come to prominence when a major event happens.""",Cyber security has hit the headlines after an unprecedented cyber-attack brought down computer systems around the world on Friday.
32014659,"Researchers said they found German coins minted during World War Two in the ruins in northern Argentina.
The researchers said that the buildings were probably never used by fugitive Nazis, because they found they could live freely in Argentine towns.
Nazis who fled to Argentina included Adolf Eichmann and Erich Priebke.
The researchers from the University of Buenos Aires said they decided to investigate the buildings because of a local legend claiming they had been used as a hide-out for Martin Bormann, a close aide to Adolf Hitler.
The overgrown ruins are located in Teyu Cuare park, near the town of San Ignacio in northern Misiones province.
Researcher Daniel Schavelzon told Argentina's Clarin newspaper that the architecture of the three buildings differed markedly from that of others in the region and that their purpose in the middle of a remote nature reserve was a mystery.
He said that a number of objects had been found that linked the buildings to wartime Germany, such as coins minted in the late 1930s and early 1940s and a fragment of Meissen porcelain made in Germany.
However, none of the objects has so far been found to have any direct links to any Nazi officers.
Mr Schavelzon told Clarin that his team thought previous theories, such as that the building had been built by Jesuit priests, were ""too simplistic"".
He also dismissed the local legend that Hitler's private secretary Martin Bormann had lived there.
Mr Schavelzon pointed to DNA tests carried out in 1998 on a skeleton found in Berlin that proved Bormann committed suicide in 1945 and did not flee to South America as had long been rumoured.
The researcher insisted, though, that the buildings in Teyu Cuare park were very unusual.
He said the walls, some of which were 3m (9ft) thick, were ""on an incredible scale"".
He also said that their location was ""completely inaccessible"".
""You'd never be able to find them if you didn't know their exact location,"" he said.
He said the theory the team was currently working on was that the buildings were constructed as a hide-out by the Nazis in case they lost World War Two.
But he said he did not think it was ever used, as the Nazis found they could live in relative comfort in Argentine cities rather than have to hide in a remote jungle fortress.
Hundreds of Nazis and fascists, some of them wanted war criminals, were allowed to enter Argentina by the president at the time, Juan Peron.
Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer who oversaw the logistics of the Holocaust, famously lived in a suburb of Buenos Aires for years before being captured by Israeli agents.
In 2000, then-president Fernando de la Rua apologised for Argentina's role in providing a refuge for Nazi war criminals after World War Two.",Archaeologists are trying to determine whether ruined buildings in a remote nature reserve in Argentina were built as a hide-out for German Nazi officers.
32919408,"Anti-smoking groups say that is too long to wait, but there have been protests by some restaurant owners, who say their business will suffer.
Austrians like order, or ""Ordnung"" as they say in German. It is hugely frowned upon for a pedestrian to cross the road on a red light. And the streets and underground network of Vienna are kept remarkably clean.
But smoky air in cafes and restaurants has been widely tolerated for years.
""Smoking is a sort of culture, especially in Austria,"" Margit Schwed told me as she sat in Cafe Ritter in Vienna, with its gilt chandeliers and marble table tops.
""In the typical Vienna Kaffeehaus you take your coffee and your cigarette. I think people like the flair in the coffee houses.""
Austria has one of the highest rates of smoking in Europe, particularly among young people: 33% of Austrians smoke regularly, according to a 2012 Eurobarometer study. Only Greeks, Bulgarians and Latvians smoke more.
A survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that 27% of Austrian 15-year-olds smoke at least once a week, more frequently than any other children in the OECD area.
Several years ago, when many countries had already banned smoking in bars and cafes, Austria first adopted the idea of introducing separate smoking and non-smoking areas.
Small restaurants could choose whether to go smoke-free or not.
Larger restaurants, like Cafe Ritter, were obliged to provide a separate smoking section, sealed off by glass partitions.
The law was heavily criticised by doctors and anti-smoking groups as half-hearted and badly enforced.
Earlier this year, after the death of a prominent anti-smoking journalist from lung cancer, Austria's coalition government of the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party announced plans to bring in a total ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars by 2018.
""We have finally arrived in Europe with anti-smoking protection,"" Health Minister Sabine Oberhauser said.
However there were protests from the far-right Freedom Party and from Austria's Chamber of Commerce.
The Chamber of Commerce opposes the ban, because it says restaurants and cafes invested around â‚¬100m ($109m; Â£714m) to install ventilation systems and glass partitions to accommodate the separate smoking areas.
The economy minister, Reinhold Mitterlehner, has said their interests will be taken into account.
At Cafe Ritter, one of the waiters, Michael Schneider, told me the smoking ban should be brought in as soon as possible.
""Working in the smoke is bad for the health of me and my colleagues,"" he said.","After years of debate, Austria's government has announced plans to introduce a total smoking ban in cafes and restaurants by 2018."
40671838,"Will that promising full-back relish being thrown deeper into the public spotlight?
What if the £200m superstar doesn't settle in Paris?
These are the types of questions being asked by clubs as they consider investing eye-watering sums on new players.
An emerging field of analysts and experts believe they have the answers.
But how do they find them?
Ever sent a tweet you've come to regret?
Last season, Burnley striker Andre Gray apologised and asked ""for forgiveness"" after homophobic tweets he sent in 2012 were shared.
And, just last week, Chelsea forward Kenedy was sent home from their pre-season tour of China after being accused of xenophobia and racism. He apologised for the Instagram posts.
But what can a club learn from a player's social media presence?
Ben Wright is head of sport at communications agency Cicero, which produces reports on players for clients across the globe, including seven in the Premier League and two in Spain's La Liga.
He says: ""We look all the way through a player's online presence. By doing this you can get an idea of what kind of person they are and how their character has evolved over time.
""We analyse media coverage, social media, fans' forums, everything that is available online, across 13 languages, to build up a public picture of their life.
""Are they using social media late at night? Do they blur the boundaries of public and private? How have they changed over time as they have begun to earn more money?
""Are they posting the kind of insight into their private lives that fans really appreciate, or is it all about new cars and new clothes? And are they posting this kind of stuff regardless of whether it's been a good or bad result the weekend before?""
Some clubs have developed in-house teams - sometimes within their scouting departments - to perform similar research.
But in January, Cicero produced a report on a promising young Premier League player, who will remain anonymous.
The analysis uncovered a series of social media posts, dating back several years, that were sexually explicit in nature, and found angry responses to opposition fans that included offensive language.
Ultimately, the client who commissioned the report decided not to offer the player what would have been a significant development in his career.
Case study: Andrea Belotti
Torino striker Andrea Belotti has been linked with a move to the Premier League for much of the summer.
In July, Cicero was asked to produce a report on the £90m-rated Italian, and the findings were largely positive.
One section in the report - written for a Premier League club - analyses the ""tone and approach"" of his social media activity, while another addresses the '""likelihood of future issues"".
Belotti's posts, which featured regular tributes to his wife and family, displayed ""no instances of bad language, prejudice or public disagreements"", the report said.
""It is extremely unlikely he would ever post something or engage with fans on social media in a way that brings himself or his club into disrepute,"" it added.
But, in a section titled ""social media presence"", it says there would - at this stage - be a slim chance of a club harnessing his online following to counter-balance a hefty transfer fee.
Belotti's 30,000-plus followers were, the report said, heavily Turin-based; his appeal is markedly different to the global reach of, for example, Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba.
Perhaps that outweighed his good behaviour? Belotti, 23, remains in Serie A, where he scored 23 goals last season.

Is he worth 100m euros?
Despite the benefits to be gained from monitoring it, social media can give players an outlet to project themselves as something they are not.
That becomes harder when they cross the white line on match day.
Geir Jordet, professor in sport psychology at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, works with several top clubs across Europe - including in the UK.
""The best way to learn about about the psychology of a player is to observe what he does on the pitch,"" he says.
Jordet has devised a model of 11 attributes that can be used to judge whether a player will succeed, or can be helped to succeed, at the very highest levels.
Among the things he advises clubs to do are watch a player immediately after they make a mistake, see how they communicate with team-mates and assess to what extent the player is proactively involved in the game.
""I have built up a research portfolio on observing players' body language in matches, and I help clubs to see that,"" he says.
Jordet says clubs must also ensure any new player must fit in with the ""coaching culture"".
""The heavy training culture at one club, for example, might be a very powerful part of their recipe for success, and they might be especially keen to sign a player who fits into that - someone like Romelu Lukaku, for example.
""But there might be other clubs who would be willing to take more of a risk on a player who does not seem to be as dedicated, because they are good at dealing with so-called problem players, those who might be easily distracted by life off the pitch.""
To put it simply - everyone is different. Two individually brilliant footballers may not play well together.
Jesse de Preter, a director at Atticus Sports Management, says everyone involved in the talent-spotting process is thinking more than ever about the personality of players.
But he still regards it as an ""underdeveloped part"" of the business.
De Preter said: ""In the UK clubs it is a permanent search for talent, and many have specialists who are involved in the psychology of targets.
""The scouting departments, even at many of the Championship clubs, are full of people, full of TV screens, they have the most expensive software available, staff travelling constantly around the world. It is an extensive system, backed by a lot of money.
""Footballers are very highly paid employees, but for some reason we still think everyone should be treated in the same way. That is the same as saying: 'OK, it is physical training today, everyone runs five miles together.'
""You can see the proof every year. When a brilliant player goes for a lot of money somewhere, and does not do well, the player is blamed, the coach is blamed.
""Then, when the player goes away to another environment and becomes a star, everyone says 'oh it was too early for him', when there will be many other factors why it didn't work out, completely linked to his personality; the way he functions in a group, or the other people in a group.""
So where does this fit in with the traditional methods used by scouts?
Tor-Kristian Karlsen is now an 'independent advisor' to clubs but he used to work as a scout across Europe. He believes that the ""expertise of psychologists is a useful addition to the scouting process"".
However, he also makes the point that the traditional role of scout - if done well - has always involved ""studying players in a social context"".
This could include observing behaviour in training, a player's standing within the group dynamic in social situations, such as at a team hotel, or their reaction to the media.
He says: ""In our environment, you have seen so much of a player before you sign him - in training, in matches, interviews - and you have spoken to people that you trust, like previous coaches and other people in the football world. Usually the total of all that information is deemed to be sufficient to make a call on a player.
""If you look at a player like Kylian Mbappe, you know that he has come through the French elite national academy at Clairefontaine, then the Monaco academy, so already you know he has gone through an excellent school with really high standards. That would make you comfortable about signing him.
""Football always involves an element of risk. I don't think even the most skilled psychologist in the world could project with great accuracy where a player is going to end up. But of course it makes sense to involve such professionals, and there are clues to be found in his behaviour on the pitch, in his reputation, in his development.""
De Preter describes the increasing focus on personality as a ""new trend"".
And while former Tottenham and Liverpool director Damien Comolli says clubs have ""always checked players' backgrounds extensively"" he acknowledges the game is changing.
He says people are beginning to ""look more at the individual as a human being before as a football player"", a trend he describes as ""one of the main current topics in recruitment"".
""High-level sport is so demanding,"" he adds. ""If we get the wrong individual in on day one, that can destroy everything the club is trying to achieve.
""When I was at Tottenham we were thinking about a massive investment on a striker who was playing abroad. I travelled to meet him, and in our conversation I asked him why he would like to join Tottenham.
""His reply was: 'Well, I would like to live in London, because there I can have a quiet life with my girlfriend without everyone recognising me in the street.'
""I left that meeting feeling very uncomfortable. He never told me he wanted to win, he never told me he wanted to help the club or help himself improve.
""This is what clubs are trying to understand before they sign players, and now I think everyone is pretty much talking about the same thing: getting the right person in as well as the right player.
""It is a trend that is not going to stop evolving, and we are only at the beginning.""","Will a £300,000-a-week salary change a hot prospect's attitude to the game?"

Hearts went ahead when Alexandros Tziolis' shot took a deflection off Keith Lasley and looped over goalkeeper Craig Samson.
And Esmael Goncalves struck twice late on, the striker scoring his first goals for the Tynecastle club.
Goncalves had an early low shot just wide before Louis Moult's header hit the bar, but the flag was up - wrongly - for offside against the Motherwell striker.
The hosts had started the match with a back three in an attempt to stymie the Hearts attack, but as the half wore on the away side became more dangerous.
First, a great run from left-back Lennard Sowah forced a save from Samson.

Then Jamie Walker threatened with a couple of fierce efforts which were just off target. He perhaps should have had a penalty when it looked like he had his shirt pulled in the box.
Malaury Martin then stung the palms of Samson with a free-kick from 25 yards, but Motherwell would finish the half strongly.
From a corner Lionel Ainsworth fired in a shot which was cleared off the line by Anastasios Avlonitis. McHugh then fired an effort over the bar.
Moult was wrongly awarded awarded a free-kick at the edge of the box, having actually been tripped by team-mate Ainsworth. Referee Andrew Dallas even mistakenly booked Hearts midfielder Martin.
Moult took the free-kick himself and the ball flew narrowly wide of Jack Hamilton's goal.
Red cards defined Motherwell's match with Rangers last weekend and another sending off played a massive part in this match.
This time it was McHugh who lunged in, catching Cowie painfully. There were echoes of Scott McDonald's red card tackle on Rangers' Kenny Miller, and it looked like the right decision by Dallas.
Just minutes later Hearts opened the scoring. The impressive Greece international midfielder Tziolis fired in a shot from 20 yards which took a massive deflection off Lasley and beat Samson.
But Lasley almost levelled moments later, his effort narrowly off target.
Goncalves has shed 8kg and with his improved conditioning and professionalism it's intriguing to ponder what he can do for this Hearts side.
The management at the club clearly believe in the talents of this mercurial player, and that belief will give Goncalves added confidence.
He looked determined to get his first Hearts goal and caused Motherwell problems all afternoon.
It finally came as he fired home with a composed finish. It clearly meant a lot to him as he celebrated with the travelling fans - for which he was duly booked.
Goncalves restrained himself from a second yellow after he scored again as Hearts made it two wins in four days following Wednesday's 4-1 defeat of Rangers.

A winner must be declared on the night - as an ice hockey rink needs to be laid at midnight for a match at the same Hallenstadion venue the following day.
But what else do you need to know?
BBC Radio 5 live's sports news correspondent Richard Conway explains.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Fifa's 209 nations will gather in Zurich for what is billed as an ""extraordinary congress"".
It was called after Sepp Blatter dramatically announced last June that he would step aside after 18 years as Fifa president.
The 79-year-old Swiss said he was ""laying down his mandate"", which has led to some concern he may not have actually resigned.
However, Fifa officials are confident he will not make an awkward re-appearance - not least because he has been banned from football for eight years over a ""disloyal payment"" of £1.3m to suspended Uefa president Michel Platini.
Both men deny wrongdoing and are appealing against their bans.
Blatter also has no accreditation to get into the conference hall on the outskirts of Zurich where the congress is being held.
There are two big issues to settle.
First, the FA representatives have to agree to a package of reforms designed to eliminate the problems that have plunged Fifa into crisis in recent months and restore its reputation.
Then, if and when that is formalised, they have to appoint a new president.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Given the hype and spin around the election the reforms have been slightly forgotten about - but they are vitally important to the organisation's future.
One Fifa insider believes it would be a ""disaster"" if measures to clean up the governing body fail.
Specifically, Fifa wants members to agree to term limits for top officials along with disclosure of their salaries.
Responsibility for everyday business decisions will be removed from the ""political"" representatives of national associations.
The ""executive committee"" will be disbanded. In its place will come a new 36-member Fifa council, which will include a minimum of six women, to set global strategy.
The day-to-day running of Fifa will pass to a new ""general secretariat"" - equivalent to a corporate executive board - and the secretary general, effectively the CEO, will be a powerful position.
The checks and balances will be carried out by a series of committees, the most important of which will be the fully independent audit and compliance committee.
Fifa wants the regional confederations and national associations to mirror their efforts over time and they will place immediate new demands on them, such as annual audits.
Media playback is not supported on this device
You would think so given Fifa's recent history. However, officials aren't taking any chances.
The proposals need 75% approval to be passed.
Acting president Issa Hayatou has been very active in spreading the message about the need to adopt the raft of proposals.
Hayatou was censured by the International Olympic Committee for his part in the ISL scandal - where the sports marketing company paid $100m (£66.2m) to officials, including former Fifa president Joao Havelange and ex-Fifa executive Ricardo Teixeira, in return for lucrative television and marketing rights throughout the 1990s.
Additionally, he has been accused of taking a $1.5m (£1.1m) bribe from Qatar to vote in favour of their bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Both he and Qatar categorically deny any wrongdoing.
So it is of interest that Hayatou has been at the forefront of the reform efforts.
Hayatou has an unassailable reputation (although not in Europe) amongst large sections of the 209 Fifa nations, despite his alleged wrongdoing. His voice carries weight amongst the ""family"" and the vote should therefore be carried without any issues.
Fifa is still in a perilous position with ongoing American and Swiss investigations into the activities of current and former officials.
As it stands, the organisation is considered a ""victim"" by the US Department of Justice. But that could change.
If the DoJ believes Fifa is not reforming or is carrying on as usual then it could be charged under US racketeering laws designed initially to tackle organised crime.
Passing the reforms are therefore vital if Fifa is to continue operating and not be shut down.
Yes. This is where it gets complicated.
The DoJ and the Swiss authorities are very interested in how the Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 World Cups were awarded and if any wrongdoing took place.
If Fifa were to be shut down it could render the contracts for both those tournaments null and void.
Geopolitically that could cause huge friction, especially given the delicate military situation in Syria at the moment.
In addition, the US is a big ally of Qatar and has a strategic air base there.
Given all of this, many question whether there is the political will from President Barack Obama's administration to carry out the ultimate threat. One insider said recently he believes there is pressure on Loretta Lynch, the US Attorney General, not to act in this regard.
Far from it.
In December, when the US made its second wave of arrests, it issued a superseding indictment.
There are 24 unnamed co-conspirators within the document, including high ranking Fifa officials and members of national FAs. Some may be cooperating with the US already, others not.
At some stage the US will have to act and a grand jury has been sitting in the US to consider ongoing matters.
In addition, the Swiss investigation into the 2018 and 2022 bidding process is ongoing. That enquiry has widened and has resulted in Blatter being criminally investigated.
Big question. No one knows right now.
If they do take action, the effect that has on the election will depend largely on who is targeted and where. The US is believed to be diverting its attention away from America and more towards Europe, Asia and Africa.
It is hard to see the mechanism by which the election could be stopped - but this is Fifa, so let's not rule anything in or out just yet.
Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain is still the front runner according to many observers.
He has the backing of his own Asian confederation and Africa, though the continents do not vote as a bloc and the ballot is held in secret.
However, such political backing from two of the biggest confederations should not be underestimated.
The national associations do not want to back the loser either… even though the vote is secret. There may be big swings in the vote between the rounds.
Fifa presidency: Meet Sepp Blatter's five possible successors
What about GianniInfantino?
Media playback is not supported on this device
The Uefa general secretary Infantino has, according to the 45-year-old Swiss' camp, made gains in recent weeks. They believe he is the man to beat.
Well, yes… but this is the same PR team behind Prince Ali bin al-Hussein's failed election attempt last May.
Back then they made very different noises in the build-up, briefing that 40-year-old Jordanian Prince Ali was unlikely to win but would give Blatter a bloody nose.
So their bullish confidence with Infantino should not be underestimated.
Infantino has strong support in Europe, South America and significant backing in the potentially crucial Caribbean.
They also think they will get half the votes in Africa. If that proves true then it's game over. He wins. ""If"" is the key word though.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Prince Ali lost the support of Europe for this election when Platini announced he was standing.
He failed to make gains after the 60-year-old former France captain was banned and Infantino stepped into his shoes.
A safe prediction for Prince Ali would be that he has between 20 and 30 pledges of support.
That means he simply cannot win - but he could be a significant player in deciding the eventual victor if he drops out and asks his supporters to back a rival candidate.
Frenchman Jerome Champagne will stay on to the bitter end but is highly unlikely to get more than 10 votes.
South African businessman Tokyo Sexwale's efforts have been something of a mystery and he has been criticised for running a lacklustre campaign.
He went on a joint visit to Robben Island, where he was a political prisoner, with Infantino on Monday.
Despite that he says he will not quit. He seems to be playing a longer game - perhaps with his eye on a new Fifa if the current organisation is ever abolished.
There are 207 eligible voters, with Kuwait and Indonesia currently barred from taking part.
That may change on Friday and the total number of voters will be announced before the ballot.
In the first round, the winner needs two-thirds of the available votes. If no candidate achieves that then a simple majority (105 in a 209-nation contest) is all that is required to win.
If there is still no winner then a third round will take place and the candidate with the fewest votes in round two would drop out at this point.
The candidates will each have 15 minutes to address Friday's congress, which is due to start at about 12:00 GMT.
In theory, the first round of voting should start at approximately 13:30 GMT.
Fifa estimates each round of voting will take one hour and 40 minutes. A safer bet is two hours, judging by previous elections.
So the earliest a winner is likely to be declared is about 17:30 GMT… let's see.",Football's crisis-hit world governing body Fifa will meet in Zurich on Friday and elect a new leader to try to take the damaged organisation forward into a new era.

38827189,"Fees in England are rising again, and it is the first fall in UK applications since fees were last increased in 2012.
The Royal College of Nursing blamed the 23% drop in nursing applications on the removal of bursaries.
Universities Minister Jo Johnson said that despite the overall drop, more 18-year-olds were applying to university.
These Ucas admissions figures, up to the January deadline for courses starting in the autumn, show a 5% drop in UK students and 7% drop in students from the European Union - with a total of about 564,000.
Universities have been warning about the impact of Brexit on their finances if European applications fall and these figures show a significant decline in candidates from the EU.
There has also been a decline in UK students applying - and like the two previous occasions when applications have fallen - this has been when fees are being increased.
The fall in applications in England of 6% has been three times greater than in Scotland at 2%, which remains without tuition fees.
Applications from Wales fell most, by 7%, and Northern Ireland by 5%.
Nursing had the biggest fall of any individual subject, and Janet Davies, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, blamed this on the switch from grants to fees and loans.
""We warned the government the removal of student funding would see a sharp drop in nursing applications. These figures confirm our worst fears,"" said Ms Davies.
She said the ""nursing workforce is in crisis"".
But there were drops across other subjects - particularly among older students not applying directly from school.
Among 19-year-olds, numbers were down 9%. And among 25-year-olds, applications were down 23%.
But among 18-year-olds, such as sixth-formers applying from school, numbers have continued to rise to record levels, up to 37% of the age group.
And there could be an upside for those who are seeking places - with universities likely to be competing to attract students.
Ucas chief Mary Curnock Cook said this ""tough recruitment environment for universities"" would mean ""unprecedented choice and opportunity for applicants"".
Sorana Vieru, vice-president of the National Union of Students, said the fall in applicants was ""disappointing, but not a surprise"".
""Uncertainty around increases in tuition fees, loss of maintenance grants and the rising costs of living and studying at university are too much of a risk to some potential students,"" she said.
Labour's shadow universities minister, Gordon Marsden, said: ""We warned the government at Christmas their sneaked-out tuition fee increases and the accompanying increased debts would have damaging impacts on students and their numbers.""
Universities Minister Jo Johnson said: ""More young people than ever are choosing to go to university, with record application rates for 18-year-olds this year as well as those from disadvantaged backgrounds.""",University applications have fallen by 5% - with the decline driven by a drop in European Union students and a sharp fall in nursing applications.
21972187,"There are concerns about the number of deaths at the hospital, which is at the centre of a long dispute over the future of children's heart services.
The medical director of the NHS, Bruce Keogh, said it was ""a highly responsible precautionary step"".
But some people have questioned the decision and its timing, 24 hours after a High Court ruling kept surgery there.
Leeds General Infirmary had been earmarked for closure by the NHS review to concentrate children's heart surgery in fewer bigger centres.
But that decision was quashed by a High Court judge on Wednesday.
Stuart Andrew, Conservative MP for Pudsey, who has led a cross-party campaign to keep the unit open, said it was a ""very odd"" decision coming after the jubilation that greeted the court ruling.
""We have always asked them 'is it safe at Leeds?' and the answer always came back 'yes it is'.
""What is the information that says that has changed?""
Congenital heart defects explained
He added he had not received one complaint about care.
Children who would have been treated in Leeds will be sent to other hospitals around England.
Affected families are being contacted directly by the trust and the review is expected to take three weeks.
Anne Keatley-Clarke, chief executive of the Children's Heart Federation, an umbrella group for different voluntary organisations, said she had raised concerns about surgery outcomes two years ago, and more recently parents had reported difficulties in getting referrals at Leeds to other heart units.
In a statement on the federation website, she said: ""My concern is that it appears that managers and clinicians in  Leeds, together with the parent support group, have put their own interests ahead of the well-being of critically ill children and their very vulnerable parents.""
Sir Bruce and senior managers from the Care Quality Commission visited the hospital on Thursday to say it must stop all children's heart surgery there immediately.
In a statement, Sir Bruce said: ""The trust has taken a highly responsible precautionary step.
""Some questions have been raised by the trust's own mortality data and by other information.
""It is important to understand that while this information raises questions, it does not give us answers.""
The chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said outside experts would be drafted in to help review ""all aspects"" of care.
In a statement, Maggie Boyle apologised to parents and families affected but assured them the trust always put the safety of patients first.
The CQC said it supported the trust's decision and it was in close contact with the trust to ensure effective arrangements were in place to protect the safety and welfare of patients.
Sharon Cheng, from Save Our Surgery - the group which is co-ordinating the fight to keep children's heart surgery in Leeds - said: ""We're mystified.
""We don't know of anything that could justify this step.""
Previously, an NHS review said surgery should stop at hospitals in Leeds, Leicester and London to focus care at fewer, larger sites, where medical expertise can be concentrated.
More than 600,000 people signed a petition opposing the closure plans. Many people were unhappy that children from Leeds faced journeys of up to 150 miles for care.

Local government minister Andrew Percy, revealed in a written statement that £15m EU Solidarity Funding received in respect of the winter 2015-16 floods would be ""offset"" by the £14.5m repayment.

One of the most successful of these theories is called the ""Standard Model"".
It explains how the world of the very, very small works.
Just as the world became very strange when Alice shrunk after drinking a potion in the children's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, physicists have found things are quite different when they study the goings on at scales that are even smaller than the size of an atom.
By doubling the energy of the LHC, it will enable them to discover new characters in the wonderful and mysterious tale of how the Universe works and came to be.
The Standard Model describes how the basic building blocks that make up atoms and the forces of nature interact.
And just as in Alice's stories it features some eccentric characters, notably a family of 17 elementary particles.
Some are familiar from school physics lessons, household names if you like.
One of the best known in the sub-atomic world is perhaps the electron, which orbits the atom and is involved in electricity and magnetism.
Another flashy A-lister is the photon, which is a particle of light.
But most particles from the Standard Model family are more niche, a little more art house if you like, and have strange names.
In fact, one of them is actually called ""the strange quark"".
And others from this group of particles are named as if by thoughtless and unimaginative parents: ""up"", ""down"", ""top"" and ""bottom"" though ""charm"" does sound a little more, well, charming.
A couple of these combine in various ways to form protons and neutrons, which along with electrons make up atoms from which the world is made. These are all members of a group called ""fermions"".
And there is another group called the ""bosons"", that quite literally hold the place together.
They are called the ""force carriers"" in physics text books and give rise to the forces of nature: electrical, magnetic and nuclear forces, which pull other particles together or push them apart.
With the discovery of the sub-atomic world's biggest celeb of all, the Higgs boson, scientists have now detected all the particles predicted by the Standard Model: a theory that beautifully explains how the Universe works in intricate detail.
Or so scientists thought.
It is incomplete. For a long time physicists thought that their Standard Model theory could explain almost everything.
Then came two phenomena that showed that it explained hardly anything.
First was the observation that galaxies are rotating much more quickly than they should.
The faster a galaxy rotates the more material it contains.
The observations suggested that they contain five times more material than could be detected.
This invisible material has been called ""dark matter"" which physicists believe accounts for a quarter of the Universe.
Second was the observation that galaxies were accelerating apart from each other driven by an even more mysterious force that the researchers who discovered it called ""dark energy"".
So all in all the Standard Model, brilliant though it is at explaining how our tiny corner of the cosmos works can't account for how the remaining 95% of the Universe works.
Even then, of the 5% it is good for it can't explain gravity.
And, just as the erstwhile poster child of physics slinks off to find a place to curl up and quietly weep, comes the biggest humiliation of all: it can't explain why the Universe exists at all.
Shortly after the Big Bang there were equal amounts of matter, from which all the atoms, stars and planets are made and anti-matter.
Moments later the two should have cancelled each other out, as ripples sometimes do when meeting in a pond, to create a gigantic blast of energy and then, nothing but light.
Our very existence demonstrates that clearly this did not happen.
You might have thought that this was bad news for physics - but actually physicists such as Prof Nash couldn't be more excited.
""It's our biggest opportunity in a generation to find out what's the next step, where do we go from here and how do we explain the things we don't understand about the composition of the Universe.""
That is what physicists are hoping for. With the Large Hadron Collider set to double its energy, physicists hope that they will discovery weirder and even more wonderful particles that will point the way to a new more complete theory of sub-atomic physics.
In other words a sequel, with new even more bizarre characters and with no doubt some twists and turns in the plot.
Book two has the working title of: ""Beyond the Standard Model"".
Scientists hope to find evidence of the invisible ""stuff"" called dark matter: the unseen Cheshire Cat behind the grin of the visible Universe we see around us.
There are lots of different theories for what the cat might look like.
Among them is an idea called supersymmetry or ""Susy"" for short.
This idea predicts new particles that are invisible partners of the ones we know already about.
One of these could be dark matter.
Another idea is that dark matter could be explained by the wonderfully evocatively named ""dark sector"".
This comprises shadowy new particles that don't obey the same forces as everything else but cannot easily be detected. They might be the invisible culprits that have been making our galaxies rotate faster than they should.
Researchers will also be looking to find particles that are manifestations of extra-dimensions that we cannot detect but are predicted in some theories that extend the Standard Model to incorporate gravity.
And the LHCb experiment will be studying the differences between matter and anti-matter in unprecedented detail.
Who knows, but possibly one of the biggest changes in thinking in physics for 100 years.
Researchers, such as Prof Tara Shears of Liverpool University who is working on the LHCb experiment hope to have their first taste of so-called ""new physics: a set of discoveries that will radically transform the theories of physics and our knowledge of how the Universe works.
""If I could have just one outcome form the next run of the LHC this would be it,"" she explained with a far away look in her eyes.
""It would be to make a discovery so unexpected that it doesn't fit with any of our theories, something that would show us that we have been on the wrong track in our efforts to understand the way that the forces of nature work, the way that matter is composed, something that will knock our heads sideways to make us come from a new direction.
""And that would be the paradigm shift and that shift, in my dreams would lead us to a much deeper understanding of the Universe.
""It would be wonderful if we could make a head start that would point us in the right direction.""
The sub-atomic world is set to become ""curiouser and curiouser"".

34711352,"But the manager of the restaurant, called Halal KFC, said it had nothing to do with the US company.
Police justified the decision saying it was operating under a false licence.
The closure comes amid concerns amongst hardliners about growing Western influence in Iran as relations with a number of countries improve.
""The shutting down of Halal KFC was due to a misunderstanding,"" Abbas Pazuki, the manager of Halal KFC, told the Tasnim News Agency.
He said police had thought the restaurant was a branch of the American KFC.
""We are part of a brand known as Halal KFC, which comes from Turkey. It belongs to Muslims and its target market is Muslim nations,"" said Pazuki.
He said the Turkish brand was a ""rival of the American KFC"".
Earlier reports suggested the authorities closed down the first branch in Tehran of the better known KFC.
Ali Fazeli, head of the Iranian chamber of commerce, confirmed that the Iranian KFC has no connection with KFC in the US, according to ILNA press agency.
""In accordance with orders from the Supreme Leader, we do not give any authorisation to Western brands"" in the fast food sector, Fazeli said.
The state media reported the opening of the restaurant as a first sign of creeping US influence, the BBC's Kasra Naji says.
Hardliners believe the recent agreement on curbing Iran's nuclear programme, reached between Iran and Western powers, may become a vehicle for softening Iran's anti-Americanism, opening the floodgates of foreign influences, our correspondent adds.
Several Western countries are seeking closer business ties with Tehran following the agreement.","Only a day after it opened, Iran has shut down what officials reportedly thought was a branch of the US fast food giant Kentucky Fried Chicken."

He was found walking in Finsbury Park, north London, on 23 March.
Mr Ayadi had walked bare-chested for about two miles, police said.
He was found in Woodberry Grove at about 22:30 GMT by two security guards, who called police.
Appealing for information, Det Con Anwen Clissold said Mr Ayadi would have ""been very distinctive"".
""It may well be that he was already injured as he made his way through the streets,"" she said.
""We are still trying to establish what has caused his burns but what we do know is that a young man has sustained some very serious injuries. I need to find out how.""
Mr Ayadi's brother, Abderrezak Ayadi, said: ""Bilel is my brother and at this moment he is lying in hospital with terrible injuries.

The glow is usually best seen from northern latitudes like Norway, Alaska, Iceland and northern Scotland.
Mr Strathdee said seeing the Northrn Lights from Manx latitudes was ""fairly unusual.""
They happen when incoming solar radiation hits the earth's upper atmosphere and excites atoms to a new energy state, emitting energy in the form of light.
The photographer said: ""I needed a place that faced north so went to Peel Hill and tried some shots over the castle which worked but half the fishing boats in the Irish Sea were discharging fish at the breakwater with enough floodlights to cover a football match!

34941396,"This time last year rugby club Wasps was putting the final touches to its move from High Wycombe to Coventry, a 75 mile journey it hoped would transform it from a club losing more than £3m a year into a thriving leisure business.
As part of its relocation Wasps did not just move into, but acquired, the Ricoh Arena stadium complex in the West Midlands city for £20m.
The fact that the Barbadian artist - famous for hit singles like Umbrella, We Found Love, and Diamonds - is kicking off her high-profile tour in their stadium is a source of pride to club executives, and an indication of how far financially as well as geographically they have come.
It also illustrates how the Premiership club sees its new commercial model as being as much about leisure as it is about sport.
""The entertainment side is where we see the biggest commercial growth,"" Wasps Group chief executive David Armstrong tells me.
It was 13 months ago that Wasps, then based in Buckinghamshire, announced they would play their home games at the Ricoh Arena, completing the stadium purchase a month later. Their first game as owners of their new home was a win against London Irish in December 2014.
A year on, the club is no longer the tenant of Wycombe Wanderers football club, but a multi-venue, multi-use business.
Moving a major sporting ""franchise"" lock, stock and barrel from one city to another is not uncommon in the United States, but in the more conservative UK, such uprooting is greeted with suspicion.
""The primary reason for moving was commercial,"" Mr Armstrong said, speaking to the BBC at the annual Rugby Expo conference at Twickenham.
""We were looking to create a stable long-term business model that would take us forward over the next 250 years,"" he adds, referring to the length of their Ricoh lease.
""With our previous business model, we were losing in the region of £3m to £4m a year. Our only revenue then was ticket sales. Food and beverage sales went to the football club, while other revenue went to our sponsors.
""We were a shell of a club, and couldn't be competitive and make money.""
As well as its new income strands, earlier this year, the club raised £35m with the issue of a seven-year bond, paying a fixed gross rate of interest of 6.50% a year until 2022 . Funds raised were used to restructure the club balance sheet and pay down existing debt, including loans acquired with the Ricoh Arena.
According to Mr Armstrong the banks backed the bond issue because of the strength of the club's various income strands.
Ownership of the Ricoh Stadium complex gives Wasps control over other income streams, not just from rugby matches.
As well as the main sports stadium bowl, the purchase also saw the club acquire the indoor 12,000-standing-capacity Jaguar Exhibition Hall, which hosts smaller music concerts, and can also be hired for trade shows, company presentations and other business use.
And the Ricoh also contains three restaurants, five bars, 20 retail units, one of the biggest casinos in England, and a 121 bed hotel. Meanwhile, football club Coventry City football club, currently top of League One, are paying tenants.
""We are now a full end-to-end leisure brand, hosting conferences, banqueting, concerts, but headed by the rugby club,"" says Mr Armstrong.
""The important thing is that the other income strands give financial stability to the rugby team, they wrap around it.""
He said that before the club moved it carried out thorough research, which showed an appetite within the West Midlands region, home to about five million people, for top-flight rugby .
""So we knew there was a potential fan base before we arrived in the area,"" Mr Armstrong says. ""The West Midlands, although it has a strong rugby union heritage, has never had a Premiership club.""
He adds: ""In addition, we were looking at what we thought was the ultimate stadium for rugby union.
""It is not too big, not Manchester United-sized.  It is a 32,000 capacity, where crowds of 19,000 and 20,000 look comfortable. And it is also the right size for us to grow into as we extend our fan base.""
And the club, which currently sits eighth in the Premiership table after four games, has further expansion plans.
Schemes in the pipeline include building a new training centre in the next year or two in the Coventry area, a second or even third hotel at the Ricoh complex, and a new 150,000 sq ft ""multi-use leisure facility with retail, and food and beverage"".
There are also plans for an expanded Wasps rugby retail business in the West Midlands.
Meanwhile, the club says it also wants to provide a ""compelling digital offer"" not only for its rugby fans at the stadium (such as ordering food and drinks from your seat), but also for its other business customers who use the Ricoh facilities.
""But we never lose sight of what we are,"" he adds. ""We are a leading Premiership rugby club, and that will always be the heart of what do.
""The revenue we make means we can invest in training centres, coaches, physios, players and salaries, to give ourselves the best possible chance on the pitch.""
Dominic Hayes, commercial director of Premiership Rugby observes:  ""I think the work that Wasps have done to up sticks and move city is a testament to the strength of the Wasps brand.  We have got to acknowledge there is some real strength there.
""Similarly with the Wasps bond, that was on the strength of the Wasps brand, not the Ricoh.""
And, while other famous music acts have played in the main Ricoh Arena bowl in the past before Wasps took over, Mr Armstrong is particularly pleased at the Rihanna news.
""For us it is important to get these big names... and it's nice to give a poke in the eye to Birmingham,"" he laughs.","When pop superstar Rihanna last week unveiled her 2016 UK concert tour dates, her choice of opening venue was seen as a vindication for an English rugby union club that has financially come back from the brink."
37434973,"In the programme, a man who said he too was a former IRA and Sinn Féin member turned British agent, alleged that the Sinn Féin leader approved the killing of Denis Donaldson in 2006.
The former spy cannot be identified because of fears about his safety.
Mr Donaldson was shot dead months after admitting that he had been an MI5 agent for more than 20 years.
Three years later, the Real IRA said it was responsible.
On Wednesday, Mr Adams said he ""specifically and categorically"" denied the allegations, describing them as ""part of the British security agencies ongoing attempts to smear republicans and cover up their own actions"".
He said he would consider taking legal action against the BBC.
""I've taken a number of cases against various periodicals, I got a number of corrections and apologies from a number of outlets,"" said Mr Adams.
""If my legal advisers give me the type of guidance that I require, I will sue them. I'm not reluctant to sue.
""That the BBC would broadcast unsubstantiated allegations from an anonymous person, a self-confessed agent, about me, I think it's very, very low journalism indeed.""
Mr Adams said there was a need for all agencies to ""fully co-operate with the ombudsman's investigation into the role of the police in the events that led to the killing of Denis Donaldson and for the Gardaí to expedite their investigation to bring those responsible to justice.""
The Sinn Féin leader said he would ""continue to support the family of Mr Donaldson to achieve truth and justice"".
Mr Donaldson had worked for Sinn Féin as a senior administrator at Stormont. He was killed at a remote Donegal cottage in 2006.
What Spotlight was told
Agent: I know from my experience in the IRA that murders have to be approved by the leadership. They have to be given approval by the leadership of the IRA and the military leadership of the IRA.
Presenter: Who are you specifically referring to?
Agent: Gerry Adams, he gives the final say.
The informer told Spotlight that murders had to be approved by the political and military leadership of the IRA.
Days after Mr Donaldson's killing, the IRA said it was not involved in Mr Donaldson's death.
But security sources have told Spotlight that intelligence received following the killing contradicted the IRA's denial.

The hostages were freed in April 2014.
Laachraoui and Ibrahim el-Bakraoui died when they attacked Brussels Zaventem airport a month ago. Their bombs and a third in the metro killed 32 people.
The confirmation about Laachraoui's role as an IS prison guard in Syria came from lawyer Marie-Laure Ingouf.
Laachraoui was a 24-year-old Belgian electrical engineer from the Brussels suburb of Schaerbeek. He had links to the jihadists who attacked Paris in 2015.
The French daily Le Parisien reports that Laachraoui kept watch over the four Frenchmen with Mehdi Nemmouche, the jihadist accused of killing four people at the Brussels Jewish Museum in May 2014. Nemmouche is now in Belgian custody.
The Frenchmen - Didier Francois, Pierre Torres, Edouard Elias and Nicolas Henin - spent 10 months in IS captivity. They had been captured in June 2013.
Laachraoui and Nemmouche disappeared at the end of January 2014, according to the ex-hostages.","One of the Brussels airport bombers, Najim Laachraoui, guarded four French journalists who were held hostage by so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria in 2013-2014, the ex-hostages say."

""I enjoyed my time at Colchester, but my ultimate goal was to move back up the leagues,"" he told the club website.
""This is a great opportunity to do that with a team heading in the right direction.

Cook, 32, resigned in February and in his first match under replacement Joe Root made 69 as England defeated South Africa by 211 runs at Lord's.
""I was having a laugh watching him in the field, running around in the covers,"" said Bayliss.
""He looked like he was enjoying it. For someone at this stage of his career, that's a good sign.""
Like Cook before him, Root began his reign as captain with a victory, scoring 190 in the first innings to help rescue England from 76-4.
At 26, the Yorkshire batsman had only captained in four previous first-class matches before taking on the England job.
""Before this Test he was a little more on edge than I've seen him before,"" said Bayliss. ""We spoke about Joe being himself, getting the message across in his way.
""He's proactive and confident and I thought that came across in the way he led the team.
""Root and Cook are different characters, they go about their batting in different fashion, so the dressing room was a little different. A lot of the messages were similar, just delivered in a different way.""
England have named an unchanged 12-man squad for the second Test of the four-match series against the Proteas at Trent Bridge, which begins on Friday.
That means the balance of the team is likely to remain the same, with left-arm spinner Liam Dawson continuing alongside Moeen Ali, who took 10 wickets at Lord's.
""The combination we had you could pretty much pick on any type of wicket,"" added Australian Bayliss, who further clarified Moeen's role in the team after saying on Sunday he thought his man-of-the-match performance could be a ""watershed"" moment.
""He wants to be in the team as a batter who bowls a little bit, so that is what we have chosen him as,"" said Bayliss.
""Mo is a bit of a complex character at times, so it's more for his benefit than anything. It takes the pressure off him. It doesn't mean he can't be the best spinner, but his number one job is to bat.
""This Test was probably a sign that this is the best way to go with him.""

By BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew
Alastair Cook looks like has he gulped in a huge breath of fresh air by giving up the captaincy.
I interviewed him on the fourth morning and was able to draw a comparison between the Cook of now and the Cook I spoke to after the fifth Test against India in Chennai last year. It was like a different man.
Cook will not be a grumpy old pro, chuntering in the corner as the team move on. He will enjoy his cricket and bat the way he does. The 69 he made in the second innings was classic Cook - playing nicely without taking the attack apart.
With his schedule - no one-day internationals - he could play Tests for a long time to come.

32165464,"Gemma Flanagan rolled herself down the catwalk for the first time at a London fashion event on Wednesday.
""It was so amazing to do it and not fall off. My biggest worry was I'd roll off the end or the side,"" she said.
Before an illness left her unable to walk, she worked as an air hostess and part-time model.
""I surprisingly felt just as confident as I have done in the past which, considering it was the first one in my chair, I wasn't sure how I'd cope with.
""When you're walking you can kind of have a little strut and do your thing. That's what I was worried about - not being able to show the clothes off as well.
""The designer's just so pleased with how I showcased their items and at the end of the day that's what modelling's about.""
The fashion show was planned by the group Models of Diversity which campaigns for the fashion and beauty industries to represent diversity, and took place at the Ideal Home Show in London's Olympia.
Gemma, who is celebrating her 32nd birthday this week, wants using disabled models to be the norm.
""The more people that are open to using models with disabilities then the more people will see it as normal.
""We've all been in campaigns that have been a one-off for companies and a lot of them aren't paid either.
""It would be good to use models with disabilities just as models, not as one-offs - we're better than that,"" she says.
As for her future, she says: ""I've got a hair show in May and a couple of shoots lined up with local photographers.
""I want to do a lot more using my chair. I'm in it near enough all of the time now. Part of me doing this show was to embrace myself and embrace the fact that the chair isn't the enemy anymore.
""It's basically seeing past the metal and the wheels and just saying, 'that's a gorgeous model' rather than 'a girl in a chair'.""
In 2011 Gemma was diagnosed with Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome, a serious condition which affects the nervous system.
She spent seven months in rehab trying to learn to speak, write and walk again.
Recently though she says she's found it harder to walk with crutches and has become increasingly reliant on her wheelchair.
""When I got ill they were hoping I'd make a full recovery,"" she said.
""But I've started getting worse again and the consultant thinks this may be the best I'm ever going to be.
""I've been a bit up and down, but now I feel OK mostly.
""I want to show other people they don't need to be defined by their disabilities.""

37750798,"Chinese electronics firm Hangzhou Xiongmai issued the recall soon after its cameras were identified as aiding the massive web attacks.
They made access to popular websites, such as Reddit, Twitter, Spotify and many other sites, intermittent.
Security experts said easy-to-guess default passwords, used on Xiongmai webcams, aided the hijacking.
The web attack enrolled thousands of devices that make up the internet of things - smart devices used to oversee homes and which can be controlled remotely.
In a statement, Hangzhou Xiongmai said hackers were able to take over the cameras because users had not changed the devices' default passwords.
Xiongmai rejected suggestions that its webcams made up the bulk of the devices used in the attacks.
""Security issues are a problem facing all mankind,"" it said. ""Since industry giants have experienced them, Xiongmai is not afraid to experience them once, too.""
It has also pledged to improve the way it uses passwords on its products and will send customers a software patch to harden devices against attack.
The recall affects all the circuit boards and components made by Hangzhou Xiongmai that go into webcams. It is not clear how effective the recall will be in reducing the numbers of vulnerable devices hackers can call on to mount attacks.
Yes, and it probably will. The smart devices making up the IoT are proving very popular with the malicious hackers who make their living by selling attack services or extorting cash by threatening firms with devastating attacks.
Before the rise of the IoT it was tricky to set up a network of hijacked machines as most would be PCs that, generally, are more secure. Running such a network is hard and often machines had to be rented for a few hours just to carry out attacks. Now anyone can scan the net for vulnerable cameras, DVRs and other gadgets, take them over and start bombarding targets whenever they want.
For the same reason you would care if your car was stolen and used by bank robbers as a getaway vehicle.
And because if your webcam, printer or DVR is hijacked you have, in effect, allowed a stranger to enter your home. Hackers are likely to start using these gadgets to spy on you and scoop up valuable data. It's worth taking steps to shut out the intruders.
Not easily. Many of the devices being targeted are hard to update and the passwords on some, according to one report, are hard-coded which means they cannot be changed.
There is also the difficulty of identifying whether you are using a vulnerable product. A lot of IoT devices are built from components sourced from lots of different places. Finding out what software is running on them can be frustrating.
Also, even if recalls and updates are massively successful there will still be plenty of unpatched devices available for malicious hackers to use. Some manufacturers of cheaper devices have refused to issue updates meaning there is a ready population of vulnerable gadgets available.
Because security costs money and electronics firms want to make their IoT device as cheap as possible. Paying developers to write secure code might mean a gadget is late to market and is more expensive. Plus enforcing good security on these devices can make them harder to use  - again that might hit sales.
Despite this, many industry bodies are trying to draw up standards that enforce good security habits. Unfortunately, these initiatives are taking time to have any impact, meaning there are millions of insecure devices already installed and working.
Right now, we don't know. Some hacker groups have claimed responsibility but none of their claims are credible. We might never know because the vulnerable devices making up the IoT attack network are changing hands regularly as rivals scramble to gain control of as many as they can.
In one sense the large web attacks are marketing exercises which show how effective a particular network of bots can be when turned against a target. Competition among rival bot operators is ferocious so a successful attack can be a good way to impress potential customers. It might also persuade victims of extortion emails to pay up rather than risk being knocked out.",Home webcams that were hijacked to help knock popular websites offline last week are being recalled in the US.

The court heard Wainwright had been drinking cider and whisky for eight and a half hours before the crash.
He will be sentenced next month.
During the trial Wainwright and his passenger,  42-year-old Jerome Lopez, had claimed that Miss Wade had been on the wrong side of the road and caused the accident but the jury did not believe them.
Witnesses from Mull told how Wainwright, who was with Mr Lopez, his mother's partner, had been drinking at a hotel, a pub and a distillery in Tobermory before having another two pints of cider in the Craignure Inn.
As he headed back towards Tobermory on the wrong side of the road his hire car smashed into the van driven by Miss Wade.
The court heard Wainwright was on Mull, along with members of his family, visiting his sick grandmother. He had flown into Edinburgh airport and hired the Maserati.
Prosecutor Tim Niven-Smith revealed that Wainwright, who worked as the first officer on the Â£6.26m yacht MY Mahogany based in the south of France, had a previous conviction for driving while unfit through drink or drugs.

Nissin, which Premier describes as a ""long-term shareholder"", is expected to take a seat on the Premier board.
McCormick, known for its Schwartz spices and Lawry's seasonings, first made a bid of 52p a share last month and then raised it to 60p a share on 14 March.
Premier rejected it ""on the basis that it significantly undervalued the company and its prospects"".
Now McCormick has said it may be prepared to increase its offer following ""limited confirmatory due diligence"", i.e. a review of Premier's pensions documentation, current trading and material contracts.
McCormick said ""it would be an outstanding custodian for the Premier Foods brands and, can provide benefits for Premier Foods, its pensioners, creditors and other stakeholders, which Premier Foods' current capital structure cannot deliver.""
Some shareholders are keen for Premier to seek a higher offer.
David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, the fund arm of insurer Standard Life, which controls 7% of Premier, said: ""Although we believe the 60p  bid indicated by McCormick is too low, we remain open to a bid at a higher level.
""We expect the Premier Foods Board, on behalf of its shareholders, to engage with McCormick and pursue this option to the full.""

The Independent Police Complaints Commission looked into police actions.
An inquest found 14 DJ announcements in 30 minutes had been the most significant cause of overcrowding.
About 900 students travelled to the club from around the country and the DJs called for universities to leave one after the other, often with just a few minutes between them.
The IPCC investigation found it more than likely police had not been informed of the event and was only alerted when a large number of people began arriving at the club.

35959949,"Nigel Farage is wondering why, as Jonathan Portes has been pointing out, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures for migration to the UK from other EU countries is so much lower than the number of National Insurance numbers allocated to EU nationals.
According to the most recent comparable statistics, migration to the UK from the rest of the EU was 257,000 in the year to September 2015, but during the same period, 655,000 EU nationals registered for National Insurance numbers (Ninos).
Mr Farage smells a rat: ""They are pulling the wool over our eyes. Ninos are a simple and clear reflection of the real numbers of people in this country, as without them you can neither legally work, nor claim benefits.""
Now the government has promised to tell us how many of the Ninos issued are still active - in other words, how many of the EU citizens who registered are currently paying UK tax or claiming benefits.
But are Ninos a good measure of immigration?
There is no question that the official immigration figures, based on a survey taken at ports and airports, are imprecise, with the ONS 95% confident that the immigration figure is within plus or minus 23,000 of the true figure.
More importantly, though, the ONS figures only aim to measure long-term migration. They use the UN's definition of a long-term migrant as someone who moves country for a year or more.
When it comes to National Insurance numbers, on the other hand, there is no minimum stay in the UK. Everyone who wants to work in the UK must have a National Insurance number, even if they're only working in the country for a few weeks.
What's more, Ninos are unique to an individual, so once you've received one, it's yours forever. This means that not all those who HMRC reveal to be ""active"" will necessarily belong to people who have been in the country continuously since their number was issued - they could have left and returned.
The ONS statistics also include people who are not planning to work or claim benefits, such as children or non-working partners. These people don't need a Nino when they arrive, but can apply for one in the future. This means someone registering for a Nino could have arrived at any time, not necessarily in the year or quarter in question.
It's not hard to see how the two sets of figures would be different. The question is, should they vary this much, or is there a problem with the way the ONS currently gathers its data? HMRC has said it will work with the ONS to help reconcile all available sources of statistics, including Ninos, to ensure the figures are as accurate as possible.
With this process rumbling on - and the latest immigration and Nino statistics due out on 26 May - this issue is sure to keep providing fuel for the EU debate, coming just a month before the referendum.
Reality Check verdict: There are good reasons why the two numbers would be different, but they are strikingly far apart, and next month's figures showing how many of the numbers are active should help reconcile the two.

The vote against Conservative ministers' Trade Union Bill is not legally binding.
The UK and Welsh governments disagree over whether the assembly's permission is needed before the new rules apply to public sector workers in Wales.
The bill would require at least half of union members to take part in a ballot before a strike can happen.
In public services such as health, education and the fire service, industrial action would need at least 40% of eligible union members to vote in favour.
The Conservatives say the bill should apply to the whole of Britain, but Welsh government ministers say the assembly's consent is needed.
On Tuesday, AMs withheld their approval of the bill by voting down a motion in the Senedd chamber.
Labour has said it will try to overturn the bill if the UK government ignores the assembly' vote and pushes ahead.
If returned to power at May's assembly election, Labour would introduce its own legislation to repeal the bill.

35937341,"The measure is ""an attack on democracy"" according to an emergency motion carried unanimously at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers conference.
Earlier ATL general secretary Mary Bousted called the plan ""madness"".
On Monday, School Minister Nick Gibb said the plan made schools ""profession-led"" - though he faced some heckling.
Under the plan almost 17,000 schools which have not already converted to academy status - mostly primaries - must do so by 2020 or have committed to do so by 2022.
Delegates applauded as the ATL became the third teachers' union to oppose the plans.
The conference, meeting in Liverpool, voted to condemn the White Paper, Educational Excellence Everywhere, as ""an attack on democracy"".
Proposing the motion, Mark Baker said White Paper's proposals amounted to ""Educational Excellence All Over The Place"".
The motion warned that conversion of schools to academy status would be achieved without regard to the wishes of parents, staff or local communities and without proper Parliamentary scrutiny.
The move represented ""ever greater centralism and micro-management"".
""It takes no account of the growing evidence of failing academies but insists on a blind adherence to an ideology with no foundation in fact,"" said the motion.
The ATL will now work with ""all those concerned"", including other education unions to opposed forced academisation and to consider what forms of action - including potential industrial action - may be needed.
In her speech to conference on Tuesday morning, Dr Bousted backed calls for a co-ordinated response.
""Alone we can do something. Together we can do great things.
""We must fight together to protect our profession, for the sake of the children and young people whose education depends on us.
""And we will fight and if we fight together, with parents and councillors, with other unions, with politicians, with governors, with the whole of civil society which opposes the madness of forced academisation, then we will win,"" Dr Bousted concluded.
Earlier in the speech Dr Bousted called the white paper a ""very strange document"".
""It asks us to believe six impossible things before breakfast, including the big whopper - that the forced academisation of all schools will improve educational standards.""
The government's plans have drawn criticism from teachers, unions and Tory local councillors.
At its conference over Easter, the National Union of Teachers  voted to ballot for strike action over the academies plan.
The NASUWT conference also voted to consider strike action if forced academisation affects members' pay and conditions.
The Labour Party has said its own analysis of official figures suggests the plan could cost £1.3bn with a shortfall in funding of  over £1.1bn - though ministers reject these figures.
But in a speech to the NASUWT Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said there was no going back on plans to make every school an academy by 2020.
Ms Morgan maintained the government's plans would improve the education system in England.
The Department for Education said it was ""disappointing that the ATL would rather play politics with our children's future than work constructively with us to deliver our vision for educational excellence everywhere"".

Bosnian Serb officials warned the move would trigger a ""serious crisis"" in the country.
In 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) cleared Serbia of direct responsibility for genocide.
The ICJ found only one act of genocide during Bosnia's 1992-95 war - the massacre of about 8,000 Bosnian Muslim (Bosniak) men and boys by Bosnian Serb forces in the town of Srebrenica in 1995.
It was Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two.
The ICJ ruled that Serbia had violated international law by failing to prevent the killings, but absolved it of direct responsibility.
On Thursday, Mr Izetbegovic told reporters that ""the request [for a review] is being submitted at this very moment"".
""I think that I am on the path of truth and justice,"" he added.
The appeal was launched before a 10-year deadline expires on 26 February.
Mladen Ivanic, the Serb member of the presidency, said the move should have been made collectively by the tripartite body, where a Bosnian Croat also has a seat.
""I am afraid that we have entered a really serious crisis,"" Mr Ivanic said.
Meanwhile, Serbia Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic earlier described Mr Izetbegovic's intentions as ""bad"" for relations between the two countries.

28399377,"Mr Blackman is championing an e-petition demanding the change in Parliament, after it was signed by more than 120,000 people.
Muslims and Hindus should have ""the most important days in their faiths recognised in law"", the petition says.
The government has already rejected the e-petitioners' request.
In its response to the petition, the government said: ""We are very aware of the importance of these festivals which are widely celebrated in the UK.
""Whilst we appreciate a new national holiday may benefit some communities and sectors, the cost to the economy remains considerable and any changes to the current arrangements would not take place without a full consultation.""
Mr Blackman pressed ministers to reconsider during a debate in the House of Commons' secondary debating chamber of Westminster Hall.
He said the government's concern about cost was ""valid"".
The MP for Harrow East said: ""According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research, each public holiday costs Â£2.3bn per day due to a loss of retail, commercial services, and other industries.
""So we're looking at an overall economic cost of just under Â£5bn if the Muslim faith and the Hindu faith were to be given one specified public holiday each, if the estimate is correct.""
But, he continued, the think tank had also estimated that annual output would be raised by Â£19bn ""if all public holidays were scrapped"".
""That's not likely to happen. I can't believe any government would every dare to decide to cancel Christmas,"" Mr Blackman said.
""So we can't make a case for or against further public holidays just on the basis of money. If we did, we wouldn't have any public holidays at all.""
There were ""bigger considerations"", he argued.
""Wouldn't it be a statement that we as a nation embrace these religions, and the people who hold them dear, and we are ready to recognise their place in our society?
""Creating these public holidays would be an important step towards promoting the understanding and tolerance of different faiths - not just at home, but abroad too.
""We want other nations to look to the UK for a good example of positive integration, and for highly skilled prospective immigrants to consider coming to our country with a sense that their faith is a respected part of their identity.""
But Business Minister Jenny Willott was not persuaded by the MP's case.

Plans for the HS2 between London and Birmingham and then to Manchester and Leeds have been developed by the government under holding company HS2 Ltd.
It promises to reduce journey times between Birmingham and London from 81 to 49 minutes, and slash the trip to Manchester by an hour, to 68 minutes.

39628723,"The report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found an average satisfaction score of 7.3 on a scale from nought to 10.
UK teenagers had a below average satisfaction score of seven.
But anxiety about exams and bullying remains a problem for many young people. And heavy internet use leaves many feeling lonely and less satisfied.
The findings are based on a survey of 540,000 students internationally who also completed the OECD Pisa tests in science, mathematics and reading in 2015.
The study reveals large variations in life satisfaction out of 48 OECD countries and partner nations.
The highest levels of satisfaction were found in the Dominican Republic (8.5), Mexico (8.3) and Costa Rica (8.2), while the Asian countries or economies of Korea (6.4), Hong Kong (6.5), Macau (6.6) and Taiwan (6.6) recorded low levels of satisfaction.
The UK took 38th place for life satisfaction, behind countries such as Russia (7.8), Bulgaria (7.4) and Estonia (7.5).
The study found girls and disadvantaged students were less likely than boys and advantaged students to report high levels of life satisfaction.
Despite reasonably high average levels of satisfaction, bullying was a significant problem for many youngsters, with a large proportion saying they had been victims.
On average across OECD countries, about 11% of teenagers said they were frequently mocked, 7% were ""left out of things"" and 8% were the subject of hurtful rumours.
Around 4% of students - approximately one child per class - reported that they were hit or pushed at least a few times per month.
But the OECD research found less bullying in schools where students had positive relationships with their teachers.
Exam stress was also a problem, with 59% of students saying they often worried that taking a test would be difficult and 66% saying they worried about getting poor grades.
Across OECD countries, about 55% of students said they were very anxious before a test, even if they were well prepared for it.
Girls had a tendency to worry more than boys, with girls in all 72 countries reporting greater levels of schoolwork-related anxiety than boys.
The report found students spent more than two hours online during a typical weekday after school and more than three hours online during a typical weekend day.
The majority said the internet was a great resource for obtaining information and more than half said they felt bad if no internet connection was available.
Students who spent more than six hours online on weekdays outside of school hours were more likely to report that they were not satisfied with their life or that they felt lonely at school.
They were also less proficient in science than students who spent fewer hours online.
The OECD research found that between 2012 and 2015, the time teenagers spent online outside of school hours increased by at least 40 minutes a day on both weekdays and weekends.
The study concluded that teenagers who felt part of a school community and had good relationships with their parents and teachers were more likely to perform better academically and be happier with their lives.
Students who felt their teacher was willing to provide help and was interested in their learning were about 1.3 times more likely to feel that they belonged at school, researchers found.
Those whose parents regularly talked to them were two-thirds of a school year ahead in science.","Most 15-year-olds report being happy with their lives, an international study of students' well-being suggests."
26780897,"The Australian and Malaysian governments say the search will now focus on an area 1,100km (684 miles) north-east of the previous zone.
The move was based on further analysis of radar data that showed the plane was going faster, thus using more fuel.
The Beijing-bound airliner disappeared on 8 March with 239 people on board.
Malaysian officials have concluded that, based on satellite data, it flew into the sea somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. So far no trace of it has been found.
Search efforts had until Friday morning focused on an area some 2,500km (1,550 miles) to the south-west of the Australian city of Perth.
Did previous photos show plane debris?
Using satellite images, several nations have identified objects floating in the sea in that search area, but these have not been located and there is no evidence that they are related to the plane.
John Young, general manager of Amsa's emergency response division, said that teams had ""moved on"" from that area based on the new information.
Acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that the fact that the search area had moved did not discount the earlier satellite images of possible debris further south.
""Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week,"" Mr Hussein said.
A statement from Amsa - which is co-ordinating the search - said the new information had come from the international investigation team in Malaysia.
This was based on ""continuing analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca before radar contact was lost"", Amsa said.
""It indicated that the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated, resulting in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance the aircraft travelled south into the Indian Ocean.""
It said that the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) had determined that this was ""the most credible lead to where debris may be located"".
The new search area is about 1,850km west of Perth and covers some 319,000 sq km (123,000 sq miles).
Mr Young, of Amsa, said it represented the ""best estimate of the area in which the aircraft is likely to have entered the ocean"" and took account of possible drift.
The new search area was outside the ""roaring forties"" bad weather zone, meaning conditions were likely to be better. Aircraft would also be able to spend more time in the area because it was closer to land, Mr Young said.
The potential flight path could be the subject of further refinement as investigations continued, Amsa said, adding that satellites would now focus on the new area.
Amsa said nine military aircraft would be scouring the area on Friday, with a civilian aircraft acting as a communications relay.
What we know
The search for flight MH370
Five ships from China and one from Australia were also relocating to that area. One Chinese patrol ship was already at the scene, Amsa said.
Mr Young said the shift to a new search area did not mean the original work was ""a waste of time"".
""This is the normal business of search and rescue operations, that new information comes to light, refined analysis take you to a different place,"" he said.
Mystery still surrounds the fate of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 which vanished from civilian radar screens less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur.
The reason why the airliner veered off course and lost contact with air traffic controllers continues to baffle experts.
The remote and vast expanse of ocean has turned the search into a major challenge.
Some relatives of the flight's 153 Chinese passengers have refused to accept the Malaysian account of events and have accused officials of withholding information.

11846369,"But back in the Indian Ocean island nation, many Tamils are either too scared of official retribution, or too apathetic to mark the second 27 November commemoration since the rebels' defeat last year.
The Sri Lankan government has meanwhile been busy destroying the war graves and other memorials for the 20,000 insurgents killed during the three-decade conflict.
One such cemetery has been turned into a playground; another in Jaffna was converted into an army camp.
And no-one knows what has happened to the records scrupulously kept by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who are thought to have financially supported the bereaved families.
Suresh Premachandiran, an MP from northern Jaffna, says his party, the Tamil National Alliance, has tried in vain to stop the demolition of war cemeteries.
""Destroying graves is unacceptable,"" he said. ""Those people who were buried there are humans. They fought for the Tamil people.""
He continued: ""Recently when some Tamil civilians lit lamps to mark a Hindu festival in Kilinochchi, the local police thought they were trying to pay homage to the LTTE war dead and beat up them up.""
In the past, large numbers of Tamils visited these war graves. In many places, cultural programmes would also take place.
But now they're not sure what to do.
""Those who lost their relatives would like to remember them,"" says Selva, a resident of Colombo, who did not want his full name published.
""But if they do any kind of public display - like garlanding the photos of people in LTTE uniform, they will be arrested.""
Sri Lanka's deputy high commissioner in the UK, P M Amza, defended his government's decision to demolish war graves, labelling them a rebel propaganda tool.
""We consider the LTTE a terrorist organisation,"" he said. ""We feel all those associated with it form part of terrorism.
""There is no evidence to show the LTTE represented collective Tamil aspiration. They have killed many Tamil leaders.""
Human rights groups say both government forces and the rebels committed crimes against humanity during the conflict.
The LTTE were accused of recruiting children and firing at fleeing civilians during the final weeks of war.
It is an established fact that the LTTE killed thousands of Tamil youths who joined other armed groups in the early years of the rebellion.
But many Tamils who are outspoken about the government's alleged war crimes say little about the charges against the LTTE.
For many in the diaspora across the world, Heroes' Day is an opportunity to gather and reaffirm their loyalty to the Tamil Tigers.
Large gatherings are planned in Britain, Canada, Switzerland, France and Australia.
Sam Krishna, media co-ordinator of the British Tamil Forum, said: ""In addition to remembering those who sacrificed their lives for the Tamil cause, we will use the occasion to focus on the war crimes.
""We will once again press for an independent inquiry.""
Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, killed on the last day of the conflict in May 2009, traditionally marked Heroes' Day with a speech outlining his agenda for the year ahead, and the Tigers would stage a military parade.
But no organisation in Sri Lanka plans to commemorate 27 November this year. Some even say the time has come to move on.
A refugee who lives in the government-run camp in Vavuniya, in the north, said: ""War has ended last year, but still we are in the camps. We lost everything due to war. There's no point in talking about it.""
Some expat Tamils feel that overseas organisations behind the Heroes' Day commemorations would do better to use their resources helping those back home who are struggling to restart their lives.","Around the world, Sri Lanka's diaspora Tamils are meeting to mark Maveerar Naal (Heroes' Day) and remember those who died during the failed insurgency."
36581319,"The excerpts, released on Monday, excluded the names of gunman Omar Mateen as well as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic State (IS).
Mateen, who killed 49 people at a gay Orlando nightclub, described himself as an ""Islamic soldier"" and pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi during his phone calls to authorities.
But in the first version of the transcript, any reference to IS or their leader was removed.
For example:
Police: What's your name?
Mateen: My name is I pledge allegiance to [omitted].
The decision to omit the names sparked outrage among Twitter users including US House Speaker Paul Ryan.
The Wisconsin Republican denounced the decision to redact as ""preposterous"" and called on the Obama administration to release the full transcript ""so the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why"".
""We know the shooter was a radical Islamist extremist inspired by Isis. We also know he intentionally targeted the LGBT community,"" Mr Ryan said in a statement, referring to IS.
Other users expressed outrage over the decision to remove IS from the text.
The Department of Justice released a statement later on Monday defending the redaction.
Officials said they wanted to remain sensitive to the victims, their families and the ongoing investigation, while also not providing ""the killer or terrorist organisations with a publicity platform for hateful propaganda"".
""Unfortunately, the unreleased portions of the transcript that named the terrorist organisations and leaders have caused an unnecessary distraction from the hard work that the FBI and our law enforcement partners have been doing to investigate this heinous crime,"" the statement said, before releasing the full transcript of Mateen's first 50-second phone call.
The other calls he made were not released.
Mateen first called a 911 dispatcher about 30 minutes after he began shooting. During the call, Mateen spoke Arabic and praised ""God the Merciful"".
In a later phone call, he told a negotiator to tell America to stop bombing Syria and Iraq and that was why he was ""out here right now"", according to the FBI transcript.
Mateen also told negotiators he had an explosive vest similar to the kind used by terrorists ""in France,"" making a reference to the November terror attack in Paris. But no vests were found.
""[Mateen] does not represent the religion of Islam, but a perverted view,"" said Ron Hopper, the FBI assistant special agent in charge.
""Part of the redacting is meant to not give credence to individuals who have done terrorist attacks in the past,"" he said. ""We're not going to propagate their violent rhetoric.""","The Department of Justice has re-issued a fuller transcript of one of the Orlando gunman's 911 calls without redactions, after facing a wave of online backlash for omitting certain words."
38167225,"There was also a record number of EU citizens coming to live in Britain with the figure standing at 284,000.
Net migration - immigration minus emigration - was the second-highest number on record.
Immigration minister Robert Goodwill said the government was ""committed to getting net migration down"".
Most of the period covered by the figures was before the EU referendum, but they also include one week after the poll.
The ONS says the net migration figure is similar to the previous year, although it was up slightly on the 12 months ending in March, when it stood at 326,000.
Immigration to the UK has also risen to a record level with 650,000 migrants in the year to June.
Net migration from the EU was the highest figure on record with the number standing at 189,000.
Mr Goodwill said the British people had sent out a ""clear message"" they want more control on immigration and the government was committed to getting numbers down to ""the tens of thousands"".
He added: ""That is why reducing the number of migrants coming to the UK will be a key priority of our negotiations to leave the EU.""
Figures show 311,000 people came to live in the UK for work-related reasons.
But the ONS said there was a ""statistically significant"" rise in the number of people who were ""looking for work"", 130,000, compared to 107,000 last year, as opposed to those who had a definite job to go to.
By Danny Shaw, BBC Home Affairs correspondent
The latest ONS figures have brought the government no Christmas cheer.
Immigration remains at historically high levels - and its target to get net migration to less than 100,000 remains a long way off.
Ministers hope the numbers will come down once they're able to exert more control over EU migration, currently at a record 284,000, when the UK leaves the Union.
However, that all depends on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations: will there be new restrictions on the ability of EU citizens to move freely from state to state?
One approach that might be considered is to limit travel to those who've got a firm offer of employment.
It won't have escaped the Home Office's notice that 82,000 EU migrants hadn't secured a job when they came to Britain - they arrived in order to look for work.
The ONS says that's a statistically significant increase of 21,000 on a year ago - and a record high.
Labour MP and chair of the home affairs select committee Yvette Cooper said the number of low-skilled workers coming to the UK was ""too high"" and her party ""should be talking about immigration"" as it was a concern for people right across the country.
She said the figures show the government's approach to immigration was not working and it also needed to look at different types of immigration.
For the first time, Romania tops the list for the country with the most number of migrants to the UK in 2015 - with 54,000 people coming to live in Britain.
China was in second place with 44,000 followed by Poland at 38,000 and India with 36,000.
UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said the figures ""just go to show that you can't trust the Tories to bring down immigration"".
He added: ""This is an abject failure, not just by the Government in general but by the prime minister in particular.""
Alp Mehmet from Migration Watch UK, which calls for a reduction in levels of immigration, said the figures show Britain needs to take a ""strong position on immigration in the Brexit negotiations"".
He added: ""Even if net migration was brought down to 265,000 a year the UK population would still be growing at half a million a year, every year for the next ten years. That is the equivalent to another five Birminghams. This is unacceptable to most of the British public.""
Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said it was ""too early to say what effect, if any the EU referendum has had on long-term international migration.""
She added: ""There does not however appear to have been any significant impact during the run-up to the vote.""
Correction: An earlier version of this report said net migration had reached a record level when it was actually just below the previous highest figure.","Net migration has stayed near record levels, standing at 335,000 in the year to June, the Office for National Statistics has said."
19875247,"These colourful lizards can scamper rapidly up walls, scuttle along ceilings and even hang upside down on polished glass.
Yet the secret of their amazing climbing ability remained a mystery until relatively recently.
The underside of a gecko's foot looks like a tyre tread and is covered in millions of microscopic hairs. Each hair splits into hundreds of tips just 200 billionths of a metre wide.
The secret of this lizard's adhesion turns out to be the relatively weak intermolecular forces that draw materials together any time they get close.
These van der Waals forces nevertheless explain how a gecko can support its own body weight on just one finger, and a single gecko hair can lift the weight of an ant.
To un-stick, the gecko pulls its foot away at a different angle.
""What we're talking about is something that is about as sticky as sticky tape - it's not crazy glue,"" says Prof Kellar Autumn, who became intrigued by gecko adhesion after being funded to develop climbing robots by the US military.
Prof Autumn, from Lewis & Clark College in Oregon, added: ""What is special about it is that it is controllable. And its controllability is based on geometry and physics, not chemistry.""
The effort to uncover the mechanisms behind gecko climbing has already yielded synthetic material that sticks in the same way.
Stick, peel and re-stick a piece of existing adhesive tape several times and it quickly loses its clingy properties.
Prof Autumn and Mark Cutkosky, from Stanford University, compared natural and polymer-based synthetic gecko hairs using a machine that simulated gecko climbing. This showed both versions could be re-used some 30,000 times without losing their stickiness.
Synthetic adhesives could yield transformative applications in robotics, industry, medicine, sports and clothing.
But one possible use always comes up in any popular discussion: could they allow humans to scale walls like Spider-Man?
In 2007, physicist and engineer Nicola Pugno, from Turin Polytechnic in Italy, calculated that a person wearing gloves and boots made of carbon nanotubes and structured to mimic gecko feet could indeed cling safely to a wall or a ceiling.
Challenges would include wear and tear and the propensity for dirt particles to collect and inhibit stickiness.
The suit would have to work on every kind of surface and for long periods of time. But Prof Pugno says: ""We are not very far, in my opinion, from a kind of Spider-Man suit.""
Prof Metin Sitti, from Carnegie Mellon University, says the idea is ""not impossible"". Selecting a lightweight person and applying the adhesive to many parts of the suit (not just the feet and hands) would improve the chances of success, he explains.
But, he comments: ""We get questions like: 'Can you carry a one-tonne weight'. And we say: 'Maybe, but that's not our biggest advantage'.""
A. The toes of geckos are covered in ridge-like lamellae, producing a tyre tread pattern
B. Millions of microscopic hairs, or setae, cover each toe. These are only as long as two diameters of a human hair
C. Each seta ends in up to 1000 even tinier tips, called spatulae
D. The spatular tips are only 200 billionths of a metre wide -below the wavelength of visible light
Several institutes have been developing robots that can climb walls - Stanford University's ""Sticky-bot"" can be seen in action here. Some scientists envisage ""geckobots"" being used to search for survivors in a burning building or disaster zone, to explore the rocky terrain of Mars, or even as toys.
But many in the field are most excited by more routine applications.
Medicine is one target area for these adhesives. They could spawn advanced bandages that can be removed easily after healing or gripping surfaces on instruments designed for delicate surgery. Since the mechanism works in the wet, it could be used to affix implants within the body.
Stanislav Gorb, from the University of Kiel, studies biological adhesion; his work also looks at the way beetles stick to surfaces.
He says gecko material has several advantages when compared with generic sticky tape. There is no ""visco-elastic"" adhesive to dry out, so it stays attached for longer and leaves no residue.
But he says that with current production methods, they are unlikely to replace classical sticky tape.
""Maybe in 5-10 years we will have a method that will make the tape very cheap - right now it isn't. Secondly, right now, the forces are in the range or even lower than traditional sticky tape.""
Zip it up
Metin Sitti thinks gecko material could provide alternatives to current ""closure"" technologies, such as hook and loop fastening, zips and sealing systems on food packaging.
It is one area he is exploring through his company NanoGripTech, set up to commercialise his lab's gecko work.
Synthetic adhesives work best on glass; rough or uneven surfaces pose more of an obstacle. Getting high performance out of gecko material on a variety of surfaces and in different conditions represents the firm's first challenge.
""We have been focusing on what happens when the surface gets wet, oily, dirty and what happens when temperatures change from very cold to very hot,"" says Prof Sitti.
""The second challenge is how can you manufacture and sell this [material] at high volume and at low cost?""
Prof Sitti is working on this problem and expects within a year to begin manufacturing at low volumes.
A silicone-based bio-inspired adhesive made by German firm Binder has been on the market for some six months. Prof Gorb was involved with its development.
The company has been exploring medical applications and the ""pick and place"" technology used in clean rooms to precisely position components on to circuit boards.
""Clean rooms often work with suction systems. That generates dust and requires a lot of energy, which contributes to the cost,"" says Jan Tuma, managing director of Binder.
""We are only sticky on really flat, shiny surfaces. It depends on the pins per sq cm and at the moment we have 29,000 pins per sq centimetre.
""Geckos have more, but they have had millions of years to develop, and we have had only a few.""
Prof Autumn says: ""We can look to Nature as a giant library of design principles. The way gecko adhesives work is so bizarre and so different from the way that adhesives have been engineered, that I don't think we would have invented it.""

European judges said doctors were required to keep the 10-month-old alive until they had passed judgement.
Specialists at Great Ormond Street believe he has no chance of survival.
Charlie has been in intensive care in hospital since October last year.
His doctors said he cannot hear, move, cry or swallow and that his lungs only go up and down because he is on a machine that does it for him.
Judges in Strasbourg, France, had previously ruled an interim measure to keep him alive should remain in place until midnight on 19 June.
The new extension lasts until a final ruling is made.
A spokesperson said the court ""will treat the application with the utmost urgency"" but have not indicated when the final judgement will be made.
Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, have raised Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for an experimental treatment in the US.
In April a High Court judge ruled against the trip to America and said Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity.
Three Court of Appeal judges upheld the ruling in May and three Supreme Court justices have dismissed a further challenge by the parents.

20077735,"The patents include one that relates to the front face of the iPhone and one for touch-screen technology.
It is another win for Apple, after it was awarded $1.05bn (£652m) in damages by a jury in a separate case in August.
The ITC can block the import of products into the US.
The judge's ruling will go in front of a full commission, which is scheduled to conclude its investigation in February.
Judge Thomas Pender agreed that Samsung violated four of Apple's patents, but was not in violation of two others listed by Apple in the complaint.
Three of the patents are related to software features, while one covers Apple's hardware.
However, the Samsung products in this case do not include its latest devices, limiting the impact of a potential import ban into the US.
Samsung has repeatedly argued that any sales ban would limit choice and raise prices for consumers in the US.
Apple and Samsung have bought legal cases against each other in more than 10 countries, each accusing the other of violating patents, as the two battle for market share in the hugely lucrative mobile industry.","A US International Trade Commission judge, in a preliminary ruling, said Samsung infringed four of Apple's intellectual property patents."
28703013,"After a year of music lessons, the reading scores of nine and 10-year-olds held steady compared to a dip seen in those who were not taught any music.
Another group of musically-trained children were found to be better at processing sounds and language.
The research is being presented to the American Psychological Association.
The research was led by Dr Nina Kraus at Northwestern University and involved hundreds of children at high schools in impoverished areas of Chicago and Los Angeles.
Her research had previously highlighted that learning music could improve the concentration, memory and focus of children in the classroom by improving their neural functions.
But much of the research had focused on the impact of music lessons on relatively affluent children.
In this study, Dr Kraus found that giving children regular group music lessons for five or more hours a week prevented any decline in reading skills, which would normally be expected in poorer areas.
Another group of teenage schoolchildren, from a poor area of Chicago, took part in band practice or choir practice every day at school as part of a music project.
Researchers recorded their brainwaves to assess how they responded to speech sounds.
After two years of musical training, the results showed the musical group was faster and more accurate at distinguishing one sound from another, particularly when there was background noise, compared to a group that did not participate in any musical activity.
Dr Kraus said this showed music could have a positive impact on the brain, which could also help learning, but it was not a quick fix.
""Research has shown that there are differences in the brains of children raised in impoverished environments that affect their ability to learn,"" he explained.
""While more affluent students do better in school than children from lower income backgrounds, we are finding that musical training can alter the nervous system to create a better learner and help offset this academic gap.""
All the children had similar IQs and reading ability at the start of the study.
Dr Kraus said music appeared to remodel the brain to improve the connections between sounds and meaning, the process by which babies learn to speak.
Children growing up in poorer areas with poorly-educated mothers are more likely to have 'noisier brains', she said.
This is because they are less likely to know and recognise a wide range of words and are therefore less able to respond to sounds and language.
""Music automatically sharpens the nervous system's response to sounds,"" Dr Kraus explained.
The children participating in the study were part of the Harmony Project, which provides instruments and free music tuition for American schoolchildren in certain deprived urban areas.","Learning to sing or play a musical instrument can help disadvantaged children improve their reading skills, US research suggests."

The M73 will be similarly affected for six weeks from mid-September, between J1 Maryville and J2 Baillieston.

32195135,"Making them vote may halt declining election turnouts and could ""kick start the habit of a lifetime"", the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said.
In 2010, 44% of 18 to 24-year-olds voted, with the ""younger and poorer"" least likely to vote, it suggested.
The UK risks ""sleepwalking into a more divided democracy"" unless there is reform, the IPPR's Mat Lawrence said.
""The working class and the young have less input into political decision-making processes, with lower rates of participation and representation than older and more affluent citizens,"" the IPPR report suggested.
Such inequalities undermined the ""legitimacy and effectiveness"" of democracy, the report claimed, saying it was unlikely the trend would be reversed in next month's general election.
At the 1970 general election, the gap between the proportion of 18-24 year olds and over-65s who voted was 18%.
However, at the 2010 general election, the gap had risen to 32% - with 76% of over-65s voting, compared to 44% of 18-24 year olds.
""Long-run decline in voter turnout in the UK is being driven by the relative collapse in participation among the young and the less well-off - not by a uniform decline in turnout among all groups,"" Mr Lawrence added.
""A distinctive non-voting population, generally younger and poorer, heightens political inequality by giving some groups far greater influence at the ballot box.""
The report comes after the voting age was reduced to 16 for the Scottish independence referendum, in September - when 109,593 16 and 17-year-olds registered to vote.
Mr Lawrence said the high turnout at the referendum, as well as the rise of grassroots groups, provided reasons for optimism.
Broadcaster and author Rick Edwards told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he supported the proposal, saying ""something drastic needs to happen"" to encourage young people to vote.
But he said there would have to be a ""none of the above"" option on ballot papers, to allow voters to express their dissatisfaction.
""The problem is politicians are more interested in serving the interests of the demographic who vote more because they are interested in winning their votes and keeping their votes.
""Therefore what is happening is that young people are getting marginalised and their interests aren't being served as they should be,"" he added.
He said that if young people felt they were not being spoken to, or were not being paid any attention by politicians, they would be even less likely to vote.","Young people should be forced to vote in the first election after they turn 18, a centre-left think tank has said."
35959855,"Eleven million documents held by the Panama-based company Mossack Fonseca were leaked to German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).
In Russia, the three main pro-Kremlin TV channels have not reported the story so far.
This is quite typical behaviour for Russia's mainstream broadcasters, which often steer clear of controversial topics involving Russian leaders.
The leak reveals a suspected money-laundering ring run by a Russian bank and involving close associates of President Vladimir Putin.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations: ""Even though Vladimir Putin is not explicitly mentioned anywhere, it is obvious for us that our president has been and will be the main target.""
The story is covered by privately owned business channel RBK and independent digital news channel Dozhd TV - sources that seldom shy away from major international stories that cast Russia in an unfavourable light.
The ICIJ report was released late on Sunday night in Moscow, missing print deadlines for newspapers.
But the ICIJ's Russian partner, the opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, featured a seven-page hard copy report and a large online version on its website. Since then, most of the popular online news sources have included reports on the story.
There has been plenty of chatter on social media. The hashtag #panamapapers has been in and out of the Top 10 Twitter trends for Russia since Sunday evening.
It seems the story has underwhelmed many Russian bloggers, who were not surprised to learn about potential large-scale corruption. There have been plenty of sarcastic jokes about the alleged sums involved.
In Germany, Munich's Sueddeutsche Zeitung - which originally received the documents - has the online headline ""Putin's rich friends - the trail of the secret money"".
The heavyweight Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung says ""Panama's state prosecutors investigate offshore firms"", while Berlin's Die Welt reports on ""The billion-dollar trails of a global affair"".
The tabloid Bild says ""Data leak reveals shady transactions worth billions"".
China's press is quiet on allegations that the Panama Papers involve Chinese nationals, partly because it is a national holiday, the Qingming Festival.
News outlets have reported the story, omitting any mention of China being involved.  However, it appears that dialogue on the papers is now being censored, as features on the Sina and NetEase web portals have been removed.
There are indications that Weibo social media users want to talk about it, with thousands of posters attempting to discuss the story using the hashtag #PanamaPapers.
Weibo shows that more than 2,000 users have used this hashtag, but posts using it appear currently unavailable to view.
A search of ""Panama"" on verified media accounts brings up no results, suggesting that the microblog's moderators wish to limit people from searching for this term.
Independent Hong Kong papers, meanwhile, highlight the involvement of the families of a senior Chinese official and a prominent figure.

But pictures of the fashion range posted online have led to criticism on social media sites.
The shoes, which have collapsible heels and pointed toes, are available for infants up to six months old.
In the latest post on the company's Facebook page, an infant in heels sits astride a miniature motorbike with the caption: ""This little #Diva, defining cool posing in her #PeeWeePumps.""
The image was criticised by a number the site's users, who suggested it was ""wrong"" and ""disgusting"" to portray infants in such a way.
It comes amid growing concern at what is seen as the sexualisation of children.
""This is not ok,"" wrote Melissa Balinski.
Another commenter, Jen, said that ""promoting products for babies this way is just sick"".
Other promotional images for Pee Wee Pumps products include babies wearing bead necklaces, sequin dresses and tutus.
The range of shoes, which features styles made from red satin and leopard-skin material, have repeatedly met mixed responses from Facebook users.
""I will definitely avoid this brand,"" wrote Barrow, commenting on a picture of a baby in ""black pump classics"". ""This is horrid,"" added Flory.
But some users left positive comments, remarking how the shoes made the infants ""look adorable"". ""Too cute,"" wrote Latoyia.
The Pee Wee Pumps website displays a range of designs, labelled ""Swanky"", ""Wild Child"" and ""Diva"".

17701212,"Passengers said it was ""chaotic"", with huge crowds snaking around corridors and a lack of senior staff.
Airport operator BAA said UK Border Agency's service was ""completely unacceptable"" but queues were easing.
The agency blamed the Easter holiday for the length of the queues.
BAA said queues began easing after 13:00 BST with passengers in Terminal 5 having to wait the longest - 31 minutes for EU passengers and 51 minutes for Non-EU citizens.
The shortest waiting time was in Terminal 4, where it took four minutes for passengers from the EU to clear the checks and two minutes for non-EU nationals.
BAA said on Friday the longest wait passengers had was 77 minutes at Terminal 3, 75 minutes at Terminal 4, and 54 minutes at Terminals 5 and 1, with non-EU passengers facing the longest wait at the time.
Matthew Donaldson, 38, from Lincolnshire, who arrived on a flight from Cape Town in South Africa at about 06:30, said he had to wait for an hour and 45 minutes to leave passport control at Terminal 5.
He said: ""It was complete chaos. Half the escalators were closed to slow down the crowds and when we got to passport control there were snaking queues.
""They gave no reason and there were no senior staff there.
""It was erratic to say the least.""
George Galanopoulos, founder of London Executive Aviation which runs private jets, wrote on Twitter: ""Just landed at Heathrow T5... total chaos! Embarrassing for London.""
Simon Baugh, director of media relations at BAA, said the earlier situation at passport control, which is managed by the UK Border Force, the section of the UK Border Agency in charge of entry to the UK, was ""fairly typical"" but ""completely unacceptable"".
He said: ""It's the UK's reputation and BAA's that suffers. There's no need for it.
""It's entirely about the level of resourcing the government needs to put in place.""
A UK Border Agency spokeswoman said: ""We will not compromise border security but we always aim to keep disruption to a minimum by using our staff flexibly to meet demand.""
She said there were extra workers at the border over the Easter period.
Culture Select Committee chairman John Whittingdale outlined his committee's concerns about the airport's service in a letter to Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Jeremy Hunt which was made public this week.
The letter, dated 21 March, said waits in excess of an hour might deter tourists from returning to the UK.
The government sets BAA targets for processing departing passengers through security but no contractual service level agreements are in place for arriving passengers, said Mr Baugh.
He said the Home Office sets an ""aspirational"" waiting time of no longer than 45 minutes for non-EU passengers and 25 minutes for EU passengers.
Mr Baugh said: ""That bears no relation to customer experience.""",Passengers have faced waits of more than an hour at passport control at London's Heathrow Airport two days after it was revealed MPs warned it may struggle to cope during the Olympics.
36427572,"At first sight, with billions in subsidies, you might think that every farmer would automatically want to keep the cash flowing and therefore choose to stay in.
But it's not so simple.
In 2014, the most recent year with confirmed figures, UK farms received Â£3.19bn. The average payment was Â£17,735. The highest was almost Â£2m.
For many farmers, particularly those working marginal land such as hills with poor soil, the subsidies act as a lifeline.
Mark Williams runs a farm perched on steep slopes near Welshpool in Wales with a spectacular view over the Severn Valley.
Sitting on his quad bike, a flock of sheep grazing nearby, he describes the payments as essential to keep communities like his going.
He says hill farming is very difficult and that the margins on beef and sheep alone are very tight, ""so the subsidy is very important to protect those farms"".
But travel the short distance from the Welsh uplands to the rich soils of Shropshire near Telford and you hear a very different story.
Bruce Udale and his daughter Isabel Moseley, who grow animal feed on their 1,200 acres, are both determined to leave the EU.
This is farming on an industrial scale, with huge fields and impressive machinery. We watch a giant tractor extend two vast arms to spray a bright green crop of wheat.
The farm attracts tens of thousands of pounds in CAP payments, but Bruce and Isabel are convinced that British farmers would be better off without them.
In their view, the subsidies swirling through the agricultural economy artificially inflate prices which means - according to Bruce - that the payments are not worth as much as they sound.
""If we don't have subsidies"", he says, ""I believe our costs would come down. Land values would probably come down, rents would certainly come down, machinery costs would come down because a lot of these things are priced at what the market thinks we've got in our pockets.
""So the loss would not be as great as many people think.""
And, because the payments come from the EU via the UK government, there is notorious bureaucracy. Isabel says it's hugely time-consuming and she resents it.
""For our children's future we should take things back in hand, make our own rules and regulations in Great Britain for our benefit.
""Now we have Brussels making our decisions. Yes, we have a slight input, but we can't change anyone's minds.""
On his hill farm, Mark Williams has an answer to that.
""If they think there's going to be any less regulation, the UK is not going to revoke sheep tagging, they're not going to revoke the licences, they're not going to revoke the burial of livestock.
""We're still going to have to put up with all of that.""
What about access to markets? Of the UK's agricultural exports, just over 63% went to the EU with about 36% going to the rest of the world.
Mark says that makes the EU a crucial outlet.
""Over 90% of British beef and lamb ends up in the EU. With such a high number, to mess about with that could have big consequences.""
But Bruce Udale argues that if the UK did withdraw, trade with Europe would not be over.
""With everything except sheep, we import more than we export, so I don't have too many worries that the EU would want to do a reasonable deal with us.""
Another hot topic is labour. About 24,000 farm workers have come from the rest of the EU and at harvest-time the most labour-intensive farms - cultivating fruit and veg - require far more.
There are no exact numbers but some estimates suggest that around 60,000, mainly East Europeans, come for the summer.
Hidden behind tall hedgerows near Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire is Eric Drummond's fruit farm, where as many as 350 Bulgarians and Romanians work at breakneck speed, picking strawberries in huge plastic polytunnels.
Without EU membership, he fears that the supply would simply dry up and paralyse production.
""It's a huge risk to your business, to any horticultural business. The whole industry relies on this labour coming into the country. So we are personally in favour of staying in because there's no word on what happens if we come out.""
But like every point in this debate, there's a counter-argument.
Bruce Udale says there could be a scheme, similar to one that operated in recent years, where foreign workers could be brought in for a temporary period.
""I say tick them in, know where they're going, tick them out when they've finished. We can't have them just coming and going.""
Farmers themselves are probably too small in number to make much of a difference in the vote, but their sector of the economy is hugely important.
Not only does the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) command the largest share of the EU budget, but also the farms themselves provide much of the food we eat.
And how that work is carried out, and how it's organised, shapes the landscape itself.",Behind the quiet tapestry of farmland stretching across the UK is a turbulent debate over Britain's membership of the European Union.

The Rotherham MP quit as shadow equalities minister and apologised for her ""extremely poor choice of words"".
The Labour leader denied claims he had sacked Ms Champion for speaking out.
He told BBC Manchester: ""Child exploitation is wrong. Child abuse is wrong. It is a crime, and it has to be dealt with.
""But you cannot blame an entire community, an entire nation or an entire ethnic community. You have to deal with it for the crime of what it is.""
Asked if he had sacked Ms Champion over her comments, he said: ""Look, she resigned and I accepted the resignation, so, clearly, I think it's right thing to do and I thank her for her work.""
Communities Secretary Sajid Javid accused Mr Corbyn of stifling debate.
The Conservative minister said in a tweet: ""Corbyn wrong to sack Sarah Champion. We need an honest open debate on child sexual exploitation, including racial motivation.""
Business Minister Margot James said she was ""enraged"" by the Labour leader's ""treatment of Sarah Champion"".
She wrote on her Facebook page that the Rotherham MP's comments ""might have been hard hitting, but that doesn't make them any less true"".
The Conservative MP for Stourbridge added: ""There needs to be a discussion about how we overcome the cultural attitudes towards women that have contributed to these crimes; and to the ways in which they were covered up for so long.
""There has been a disgraceful history of shouting down brave Labour women MPs who have stood up to community pressures in Northern cities like Keighley (just google former MP Ann Cryer) and Rotherham in exposing these crimes, of which the appalling treatment of Sarah Champion is yet another chapter.""
Conservative former Children's Minister Tim Loughton said he did not know if Ms Champion had been sacked or not - but he accused Mr Corbyn of being ""deaf to a problem that is happening in our country"".
The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it was a ""real shame"" that Ms Champion had resigned because of ""over-sensitivity about language"".
Labour's shadow justice minister, Yasmin Qureshi, refused to be drawn on whether it was right that Ms Champion had stepped down.
""I think you need to ask Sarah that question,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""Of course we should deal with abuse wherever it occurs and we should ask ourselves as to what we can do to ensure these things don't happen.""
Ms Champion's article was written after 17 men were convicted of forcing girls in Newcastle to have sex.
The men, who were mostly British-born, were of Iraqi, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iranian and Turkish heritage.
In interviews following the convictions, the Labour MP said such crimes involved ""predominately Pakistani men"" and a fear of being called racist was hampering the authorities' investigations.
She then wrote the Sun article, which also included the line: ""These people are predators, and the common denominator is their ethnic heritage.""
Among the article's critics was fellow Labour MP Naz Shah, who said it was ""irresponsible"" and ""setting a dangerous precedent"".
Following the backlash, Ms Champion sought to distance herself from the article, claiming it had been altered, something denied by the newspaper.
Announcing she was stepping down, Ms Champion said: ""I apologise for the offence caused by the extremely poor choice of words in the Sun article on Friday.

Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also offered support.
But Argentine officials said they were not worried by possible reprisals over the nationalisation.
Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced the measure on Monday, saying she was asserting sovereignty over Argentina's energy resources.
Her government is taking 51% of YPF, wiping out Repsol's 57.4% majority stake.
The move has wide support in Argentina but has provoked outrage in Spain, which has threatened reprisals.
The Spanish government will consider what measures to take at a cabinet meeting on Friday, and has also been rallying international support.
""There are going to be very clear interventions on the part of the European Union,"" Trade Secretary Jaime Garcia Legaz said, without revealing further details.
It is not clear what any reprisals might involve.
EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday.
Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said Spain would also raise the issue with the IMF, the World Bank and the G-20.
""We will try to pressurise Argentina so that it sees that this road is going nowhere,""  he said after meeting Hillary Clinton.
He added that Spain and the US had agreed to work together to ""re-establish international legality"".
But the Argentine government says it will not back down in its decision to nationalise YPF, which it says is a lawful action taken in the national interest.

In his profile on the LinkedIn social media website, Mr Duffus said he had been employed by Blue Hackle since 2005, and was working as a site security manager.

36356695,"Speaking during a visit to communist Vietnam and talks with its leaders, Mr Obama said the move removed a ""lingering vestige of the Cold War"".
The US is trying to bolster its relationship with its Pacific allies, as China asserts territorial claims.
But Mr Obama said the embargo decision was not related to US policy on China.
""It's based on our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards normalisation with Vietnam,"" he said in Hanoi.
Vietnam is one of several countries in the region involved in maritime disputes with China. The US insists on the right to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.
In 2014, a row over a Chinese oil rig near the Paracel islands led to clashes between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels and anti-China riots in Vietnam.
Why Vietnam wants US weapons
Beijing's new South China Sea islands
High hopes for Obama visit
White House officials had indicated the arms ban, in force since 1984, would be lifted only if human rights in Vietnam improved.
""Sales will need to still meet strict requirements, including those related to human rights, but this change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself,"" Mr Obama said after talks with President Tran Dai Quang.
Vietnam had been arguing for an end to the embargo, which was partially lifted in 2014.
President Obama's easing of all remaining restrictions on arms sales to Vietnam is powerfully symbolic. But what does it mean in practice?
Up to now, Vietnam has relied on Russia to supply most of its defence equipment, a legacy of the Cold War, when they were allies. The government would certainly like to diversify its sources, and is looking at a number of potential alternative suppliers. But it won't be rushing into the arms of US manufacturers just yet.
One reason is that a lot of US technology may be too sophisticated and expensive for Vietnam's needs. And while Vietnam's defence spending, which has doubled over the past decade, is driven by the rivalry with its giant neighbour China, it will not want to antagonise China by seeking state-of-the-art US weapons that might alter the military balance.
Another reason is the complicated process of procuring US weapons. In his announcement, Mr Obama said any military contracts would still be subject to provisos on human rights, and given the Vietnamese government's poor human rights record that might hold up possible arms sales in Congress.
The greatest potential for US sales probably lies in areas like military surveillance systems and coastal defence. Vietnam would welcome technology that helps it track Chinese naval forces. The partial lifting of the embargo two years ago was with the specific aim of improving US sales in this area, yet Vietnam is taking its time to decide what it most wants to buy.
Mr Obama's visit comes 41 years after the end of the Vietnam War in which the US sought to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam.
Several million Vietnamese - civilians, communist fighters and South Vietnamese soldiers - were killed, as well as more than 58,000 US soldiers.
By the end of the war in 1975, the communists had gained control of the entire country.
While in Vietnam, Mr Obama is expected to meet dissidents and make the case for Vietnam to remove obstacles to the US-led Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal.
Amnesty International on Monday accused Vietnamese authorities of ""carrying out their repressive business as usual"" in arresting six activists.
""Before leaving Vietnam, President Obama must insist on the release of all prisoners of conscience,"" said its international advocacy director, T Kumar.
In a separate move, Vietnamese officials have removed the accreditation of the BBC's Jonathan Head in Hanoi after accusing him of conducting an unauthorised interview - something he denies.
The US president flies later to Japan for a summit of the G7 industrialised nations. His visit will include a tour of Hiroshima, where the world's first nuclear attack was carried out in 1945 by the US, killing at least 140,000 people.
The lifting of the US arms embargo ""will tighten the strategic pressure on China"", Vietnamese Communist Youth Union newspaper Tuoi Tre says on its website.
""It will also provide Vietnam with leverage in future arms deals with traditional weapons suppliers, particularly its long-time security patron, Russia,"" the paper says.
China's privately-owned portal Sina News sounds a note of alarm, saying that the lifting of the arms embargo ""is a cause for concern"" because it may have an impact on territorial disputes in the South China Sea.
A commentary (in Chinese) by Phoenix TV's news anchor Cheng Helin on Sina's ""Headlines Blog"" argues that Vietnam is being drawn into ""co-operation to contain China"" as part of ""a three-way alliance with the US and Japan"". But, says the author, the US is unlikely to sell Vietnam sophisticated weapons.

""I didn't know what would happen after that, if I'm honest. But we've got a good team.""
By guiding Wales to a brilliant 3-1 win over Belgium in last Friday's quarter-final, Coleman has already overseen his country's greatest footballing achievement.
They venture into the unknown on Wednesday with their first semi-final, whereas Portugal will be appearing in the last four of a major tournament for the seventh time.
Fernando Santos' side are the bookmakers' favourites in Lyon, though they have yet to win a game in 90 minutes in France.
They will inevitably look to captain and record goal-scorer Cristiano Ronaldo for inspiration, and his duel with Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale has been the subject of much attention in the build-up to the game.
Another Real player, centre-back Pepe, could have an important role to play as Portugal aim to subdue the threat of Bale, who is second in the Euro 2016 scoring charts with three goals.
Pepe returned to training on Tuesday having struggled with a thigh injury and, with the defender's confrontational style in mind, Coleman was asked about potential gamesmanship from Portugal.

40719743,"Researchers assessing the results of nearly 200 studies say sperm counts among men from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, seem to have halved in less than 40 years.
Some experts are sceptical of the Human Reproduction Update findings.
But lead researcher Dr Hagai Levine said he was ""very worried"" about what might happen in the future.
The assessment, one of the largest ever undertaken, brings together the results of 185 studies between 1973 and 2011.
Dr Levine, an epidemiologist, told the BBC that if the trend continued humans would become extinct.
""If we will not change the ways that we are living and the environment and the chemicals that we are exposed to, I am very worried about what will happen in the future,"" he said.
""Eventually we may have a problem, and with reproduction in general, and it may be the extinction of the human species.""
Scientists not involved in the study have praised the quality of the research but say that it may be premature to come to such a conclusion.
Dr Levine, from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, found a 52.4% decline in sperm concentration, and a 59.3% decline in total sperm count in men from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
The study also indicates the rate of decline among men living in these countries is continuing and possibly even increasing.
In contrast, no significant decline was seen in South America, Asia and Africa, but the researchers point out that far fewer studies have been conducted on these continents. However, Dr Levine is concerned that eventually sperm counts could fall in these places too.
Many previous studies have indicated similar sharp declines in sperm count in developed economies, but sceptics say that a large proportion of them have been flawed.
Some have investigated a relatively small number of men, or included only men who attend fertility clinics and are, in any case, more likely to have low sperm counts.
There is also concern that studies that claim to show a decline in sperm counts are more likely to get published in scientific journals than those that do not.
Another difficulty is that early methods of counting sperm may have overestimated the true count.
Taken together these factors may have created a false view of falling sperm counts.
But the researchers claim to have accounted for some of these deficiencies, leaving some doubters, such as Prof Allan Pacey of Sheffield University, less sceptical.
He said: ""I've never been particularly convinced by the many studies published so far claiming that human sperm counts have declined in the recent past.""
""However, the study today by Dr Levine and his colleagues deals head-on with many of the deficiencies of previous studies.""
But Prof Pacey believes that although the new study has reduced the possibility of errors it does not entirely remove them. So, he says, the results should be treated with caution.
""The debate has not yet been resolved and there is clearly much work still to be done.

32621768,"From the moment it premiered at last year's Cannes Film Festival, Bande de Filles, or Girlhood, was a homegrown hit.
The film - ""a work of cinematic art"" according to The Guardian - made more than Â£1m (1,346 euros) at the French box office, was nominated for four prestigious Cesar awards and secured an international film release.
Girlhood is the story of a black teenager, Marieme, who lives in the vast banlieues, or suburbs, of Paris. With a dead-end future in front of her, she forms a relationship with a group of other young girls.
None of its leads, including Parisienne Karidja Toure who plays Marieme, had ever acted before - a consequence, says director Celine Sciamma, of her not being able to find enough professional black actresses for the roles.
""We were looking for four months,"" she recalls, ""with a casting director and two assistants. We basically went everywhere.
""We went to agencies, but there were very few black girls. And then we went in to theatre classes and high schools, but we met most of our cast randomly on the street.
""We had to invent a group, with its alchemy and energy. But we also needed girls with wit, who were able to improvise, because some of the scenes required it.
""All the girls are non-professionals, whereas all the boys had already been on screen. That says something about the representation of black women in cinema.""
Toure, 21, was asked to audition as she sat outside a restaurant in Paris's 14th arrondissement. ""At first I thought the casting process was a little strange,"" she admits.
""But there aren't many black actresses in Paris, so they had to do it that way. You know, black teenagers in Paris, boys and girls, don't watch French movies.
""When you watch French films, you don't see many black characters. So we boycott them, and watch American movies instead.
""During the casting there were around 300 girls, who all have dreams about being actresses. But I guess we don't really believe we can do it, because we don't see many others doing it.""
Like Richard Linklater's Oscar-winning Boyhood, Girlhood is a coming-of-age movie. The circumstances, though, are vastly different.
Sciamma grew up in the Paris suburbs herself and says she was writing ""from the things I know - that there are people who have such energy, but they are not given a vision of who they should be.""
Told by her teacher to stop studying and get a job, Marieme plays truant with her new group of friends and becomes a gang fighter. Soon, footage of her beating up other girls is filmed and put on to social media.
""It's very true to life,"" says Toure. ""If you know the suburbs, you know you have the same gangs, the same fights - every French teenager can relate to it.
""Even when I read the script, there were similarities to my life. I've been followed in stores by shop security guards who are told to do it just because I am black.
""My own teacher told me not to bother continuing to study, but to go and get a job.""
""I wanted to make a contemporary film,"" explains Sciamma, ""and this is an important part of contemporary culture in France.
""The situation is defined by our history with France's former colonies, France's urban policies, even France's architectural choices with the housing estates that make up the banlieues.
""It's a very French setting with an universal plot, which is why I think it's being seen by an international audience.""
Girlhood earned Sciamma a Cesar nomination for best director, while Toure was nominated as most promising actress.
""I was only the second black actress to be nominated for a Cesar in France,"" she points out. ""I think this has to have an impact on the film industry.""
""Girlhood is statistically and symbolically a step,"" Sciamma goes on. ""It can change something because it did well at the box office. It shows that there is an audience and an interest for black characters.
""The film allowed the faces of four young black women to be everywhere in the street of Paris, on billboards, in the subway. I hope it means more stories are on the way.""
Toure has gone back to study but hopes to continue acting. ""Lupita Nyong'o is my inspiration,"" she says. ""I think perhaps her breakthrough in 12 Years a Slave was the British having their own Girlhood moment.
""I love her performances, but most of all she's a very dark black woman and she's proud of her colour. That's what I want.""
Girlhood is out in the UK and Ireland on 8 May.",The director and lead actress of a film about female teenagers that has been an award-winning hit across the Channel say they hope it will pave the way for more French films about young black women.

Wander through the tight streets and it's hard to see that anything is different - it looks and feels the same as it always has - but a silent revolution is under way.
Since 2010, national spending on local government has halved and all of our communities are having to make do with less.
In Selby, the police cells and magistrates court have been closed, CCTV and bus services have been cut back, street wardens have been axed and many of the street lights turn off at midnight.
And a voluntary army is at work.
On the outskirts of the town, Terry Heselton manages a team of volunteers who run Barlby library - which would have closed without their efforts.
""Most people would prefer it if the council could carry on providing the library service, but in the real world that's simply not going to happen,"" he says.
Nationally, the number of library volunteers has almost doubled since 2010. It is a new model of civic provision and it brings savings, but Terry says he had doubts.
""Your initial reaction as a group of volunteers is 'we're taking people's jobs, aren't we?' And I'm sure there are some people who still think that, but at the end of the day, I think we now know year-on-year, there's increasing cuts. We're never going to go back to running things the way they used to be.""
North Yorkshire County Council funds many of the services in Selby, but its spending power is shrinking by a third.
The council has already saved £116m and it says it has done what it can to protect frontline services, with 60% of the savings found in the back office and more than 100 managers leaving.
Gary Fielding has to make the figures work. He says the first cuts were genuine efficiency improvements, but it's got harder.
""You go for the low-hanging fruit, you then grasp for the medium-height fruit and we're now getting the stepladders out and really climbing up that tree,"" he says.
""We will always provide essential services to the most vulnerable, but change has got to happen - even on frontline services.""
Eighty-year-old Jean Collins volunteers in the Age UK Selby District offices in the town centre.
The council used to pay for workers at the charity to visit isolated elderly people in their homes as part of a befriending scheme, but funding has now been redistributed to other Age UK organisations in Yorkshire and other befriending services in the town.
The charity can now only afford to pay for a phone line in the office.
One person affected by the changes is 87-year-old Betty McIntyre, who lives on her own in the village of Brayton, just outside Selby.
She had a fall last year and has been confined to a chair in her living room for seven months. In one recent call, she told Jean: ""I've been crying my eyes out because I've been so upset. All the painkillers - it's not doing me any good.""
She understands why the visits have become phone calls but says: ""You feel closer to the people who are coming to visit you than [those who talk] on the phone, you get a picture of them.""
Betty is worried about how the cuts affect people in her age group and says they can't get the help they need.
Selby has a Conservative MP, Nigel Adams, and District and County Councils with Tory majorities. Like voters across the country, people here chose a government which promised to balance the books, but that means changes to basic services.
With the closure of the police cells, anyone arrested has to be taken to York - 15 miles away. In time, the station building itself is expected to shut and the police will move into the council building.
There are 161 fewer officers in North Yorkshire than there were in 2010. The local police force has lost about £10m from its £147m annual budget and it too is making more use of volunteers.
In the village of Eggborough, south of Selby, the police station is only open to the public thanks to the unpaid locals who staff the desk.
The volunteers also patrol the countryside looking for crime, wearing police-style uniforms and driving a sponsored car.
""We're just another [pair of] eyes and ears for the police service, because rural crime covers a big, big area and it is a little bit difficult to police it. We're not there to take their role,"" says Steve Barker, who has volunteered since December 2014.
Their work is overseen by force control and North Yorkshire Police say the volunteers aren't used to replace funded services.
But they are part of a new civic order. Volunteers have always supported communities - but here in Selby they are increasingly at the heart of important services.

14728563,"For a man supposedly worth millions, you would not know it by his boots. When the BBC interviewed Col Gaddafi in March, I was expecting the meeting to take place at a secret desert pavilion. Instead it was a seaside restaurant in central Tripoli. His eyes were hidden behind gold Cartier sunglasses. His flowing brown robes gave off the light scent of sandalwood. ""I don't like money,"" he said. ""I have a tent"". One look at his black cowboy boots and you would think he was telling the truth. The soles were cracked and pitted, the heels worn. Last week, when I walked around his Bab al-Aziziya compound on the day it fell, I saw where the money had gone. He had a tent like no other tent in the world. But by the end of the day it was just ashes.
The next image shows the last big demonstration in the Tripoli area of Tajoura before the authorities cracked down with pre-dawn raids and mass arrests. It was just after prayers one Friday in March. I went back the following week when the BBC team broke away from their government minders at the Rixos Hotel. There was no demonstration. The anti-Gaddafi graffiti had been painted over and the local imam told us many young people had been taken away during the night. Soon after we turned up, government heavies arrived in minivans to take us away. This was the last time journalists were able to move easily around the capital before it fell five months later.
The next audience with Col Gaddafi was on 2 March, the anniversary of the ""establishment of the people's authority"". This is when Col Gaddafi says he handed over all power to the people, so he could not technically stand down. The crowd was delighted, the rest of us bemused because he arrived in a brand new golf buggy, its front seat draped with a white sheepskin rug. He talked for three hours. Occasionally he allowed some chants and cheers, and then tapped his microphone, at which the crowd promptly shut up. The last time I saw Col Gaddafi, he was driving his buggy towards a lamp post. But his security team cleared a path and he drove off with two secret service types clinging to the back.
This was one of the government soldiers who had taken back the town of Zawiya, near Tripoli, from the rebels. The fighting was brutal as was the treatment of those arrested by the authorities. Some BBC colleagues were detained for 24 hours and subjected to mock executions. When journalists did get in, it was by media bus under strict supervision of the authorities, but the green-and-white bunting could not hide the scale of the destruction. The makeshift cemetery in the town square, where the rebels had buried their fallen fighters, had been bulldozed. The rebels winning it back proved to be a turning point in the war.
The man below was typical of the rebel fighters on the eastern front outside Ajdabiya in April. They were mostly disorganised and ill-disciplined. He was among those who fled at the first sign of an incoming round. It was at this time that the Libyan government was trying to push the idea that these fighters were linked to al-Qaeda. We tended to see them as more of a danger to themselves than to us. Their evolution into a proper fighting force took many months and some training from foreign military experts. Combined with a steady stream of new weapons and Nato's air campaign, over time they became a force to be reckoned with.
Years of being silenced have led to an explosion of graffiti in Libyan towns and cities. Artists played a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities in Tripoli - they sprayed by night and government lackeys whitewashed by day. This wall - in Liberation Square in Misrata - is in no danger of being repainted. Less artistic but more poignant was graffiti by the family of Abdel Salem Fouzy Alshaba, a 23-year-old economics student. The day after I took this picture, I watched him die at a hospital on the city's western front line. He sustained head and back injuries from a grad rocket fired by Gaddafi forces. Within days, his family was using a spray can to rename streets across the city in his honour.
This building in the Bab al-Aziziya compound is where Col Gaddafi made most of his anti-Western speeches. It was bombed in 1986 by US warplanes in revenge for a nightclub bombing in Germany that targeted US servicemen. The fist crushing the US fighter jet symbolised Col Gaddafi's defiance. After the compound fell to rebel forces, young men were queuing to have their photo taken on it. A few days later, someone ""liberated"" the famous fist from its mount and it has not been seen since.
They could not get to the man so they were tearing apart everything he owned. This was inside Gaddafi's compound, where I watched rebels walking away with vases, paintings and fridges. What they could not carry, they smashed to pieces. Comparisons have been drawn with the fall of Baghdad, raising fears of what may follow. But Tripoli is a very different story. Only symbols of the regime have been attacked. The rest of the city has remained largely secure.
This would have got this young boy's family in a lot of trouble a few months ago. But the images people were once forced to mount at their homes and businesses are now used to show their contempt for the regime. This was outside a hospital in Misrata. But everywhere in Tripoli, people are walking over images of the self-styled father of the nation. Libyans have lived with the cult of Gaddafi for more than four decades. No-one knows where he is hiding, but what is clear is that this young Libyan is not going to grow up like his parents - in Col Gaddafi's shadow.","BBC's Middle East Bureau Editor Paul Danahar reflects on six months of covering the Libyan uprising from both sides of the conflict, using pictures of some of his more memorable moments."

By Bridget KendallDiplomatic correspondent, BBC News
Usually there is fierce competition to secure one of the 10 rotating seats on the UN Security Council - a chance to sit alongside the five permanent members for two years  on the top UN body which rules on international security issues.
Instead Saudi Arabia  has used the coveted position to lodge a very public protest.
This is the second protest from Saudi Arabia. Earlier this month the Saudi foreign minister pulled out of giving a speech at the UN General Assembly, expressing similar frustration.
It is a dramatic gesture, but whether it makes immediate reform of the Security Council more likely, as the Saudis demand, is probably questionable.
Saudi Arabia has previously expressed frustration at what it sees as an international failure to act on Syria, where it staunchly backs the rebels.
The announcement came hours after Saudi Arabia was elected for the first time to one of the 10 rotating seats on the Security Council.
The non-permanent members sit on the council for two years, along with the five permanent members - the US, the UK, France, China and Russia.
As well as accusing the council of ""double-standards"" and demanding reform, the Saudi foreign ministry pointed to its failure ""to find a solution to the Palestinian cause for 65 years"", which had led to ""numerous wars that have threatened world peace"".
It also criticised the UN's ""failure"" to rid the Middle East region of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons.
And it accused the UN of allowing the Syrian government ""to kill its own people with chemical weapons... without confronting it or imposing any deterrent sanctions"".
The UN Security Council last month finally broke a two-and-a-half year deadlock on how to deal with conflict in Syria after voting unanimously to adopt a binding resolution on ridding the country of chemical weapons.

The 43-year-old returned to the Outback as part of a TV special, revisiting the place where the 28-year-old was shot.
Bradley Murdoch was convicted in 2005 of murdering Mr Falconio and assaulting Ms Lees, then 27, on a remote stretch of highway on July 14 2001.
The murder took place near Barrow Creek, about 200 miles north of Alice Springs.
The couple, from Huddersfield, were travelling when Murdoch waved down their camper van and shot Mr Falconio in the head.
Ms Lees was threatened with a gun, punched in the head and bound with cable-tie restraints before she managed to escape, hiding in bushes for hours while her attacker stalked her with a dog.
Murdoch is believed to have hidden Mr Falconio's body, which has never been found, despite extensive searches.
Ms Lees said she had ""no choice"" but to run from Murdoch because ""it was either run or be raped and killed"".
In adverts for the special edition of 60 Minutes, she says: ""Pete's still missing. I know that he's somewhere here.""
Asked if she is ""stepping inside"" her attacker's mind, she says: ""I guess it is a very alien thing for me to do because I'm not a violent person.
""I'm not a murderer but if that's what I have to do and that's how I'm gong to find Pete then that's what I'm prepared to do.""

Speaking at his inquest, his mother Elizabeth Lewis accused Betsi Cadwaladr health board of not listening to her concerns.
The trust said it would give the family a written apology.
Coroner Nicola Jones recorded a narrative verdict, saying it was impossible to say for certain whether Mr Lewis' death was an accident or suicide.
The inquest in Caernarfon previously heard that Mr Lewis, a paranoid schizophrenic, had been sectioned at the hospital's Hergest unit for an alleged assault on his mother, who cared for him.
He was later moved to the Cynan ward, where the day before his death he was refused extra medication for feeling agitated.
A police officer also visited the ward a few days earlier to speak to Mr Lewis about his bail arrangements, a visit which consultant psychiatrist Dr Olufemi Adebajo told the inquest he was ""extremely unhappy"" about.
After the hearing, North Wales Police said the officer had acted ""perfectly reasonably"".
Supt Nigel Harrison confirmed Mr Lewis had previous contact with the police and an officer did visit him in hospital to undertake a ""legal requirement"" and ""having sought permission to do so"".
He said: ""As part of our multi agency work with our partner agencies, we regularly hold meetings with the local health board, where the now raised concerns by the consultant will be discussed.
""The coroner made it clear that the officer acted perfectly reasonably and we are satisfied that our officers acted entirely appropriately throughout.""
Speaking at the inquest on Friday, the trust's clinical director of mental health, Dr Sandeep Matthews, said they ""could have engaged more with Mrs Lewis, and taken her views on board"".
Questioned by the coroner, he agreed that ""on the balance of probability"" the trust had breached their duty of care to Mr Lewis.

The piece was found during renovation of the artist's previous home in Whitworth Terrace, Spennymoor, by new owners Joe and Deborah Smith.
Auctioneer and art expert John Anderson said it was ""a piece of salvage that may yield a masterpiece"".
""Most artists, if suddenly touched by the muse will grab whatever is available to work out the inspiration,"" he said.
The artist, who died last year, started working in the mines when he was 14 and became famous for his paintings of everyday life in the industrial North East after attending the Pitman's Academy.
""In this case, presumably, he looked at it and thought 'there's a painting I'm not satisfied with',"" said Mr Anderson.

Mr Corbyn is being challenged for the leadership by Owen Smith. The result of the election will be announced on 24 September.
The Labour leader, who has said he wants the arts to be a priority for the next Labour government, has received a number of celebrity endorsements in recent weeks.
Birmingham-based UB40, named after the then government's unemployment benefit form, were one of the most successful British groups of the 1980s and 1990s, notching up 50 hit singles - among them the chart toppers Red Red Wine, Can't Help Falling in Love and I Got You Babe.
Although three members of the original line-up have left in recent years, sparking a legal dispute over the use of the band's name, the remaining members led by guitarist and vocalist Robin Campbell have endorsed Mr Corbyn.
""Jeremy has re-ignited an interest in politics for people who no longer felt included, and engaged and inspired a new generation of young voters who, for the first time, believe that they have an incorruptible politician who truly represents them,"" Mr Campbell said.
Drummer Jimmy Brown said Mr Corbyn was the only frontline politician ""willing to speak up for working people who have been badly treated by successive governments, including New Labour, in recent decades"".
Mr Corbyn, who is opposed by the majority of his MPs and lost a vote of no confidence after the EU referendum, welcomed the band's backing ahead of a planned joint appearance on Tuesday.
""UB40's story was and remains inspiring; people from across cultures and backgrounds coming together and combining their talents - in a time when prejudice was more prevalent - and creativity to produce music that has endured across decades,"" he said.
As part of his arts manifesto released last month, Mr Corbyn pledged that all primary schools in England would get extra cash to fund arts activities and a single national scheme for arts scholarships would be set up.
The Labour leader told the Guardian on Monday he would be happy to meet JK Rowling to discuss their differences after she said he was taking the party in the wrong decision.

The incident that led to his conviction took place in Hull city centre on 15 February.

Convoys of UN trucks on Wednesday began delivering much-needed aid to 80,000 people in five other besieged areas.
The UN says 200,000 residents remain besieged in parts of Deir al-Zour.
""It's a complicated operation and would be in many ways the first of its kind,"" Egeland said of the air drops.
The UN will work with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and other local groups to drop aid by parachute for distribution, World Food Programme spokeswoman Bettina Luescher said.
She did not specify when the air drops would begin but said a single aircraft would be used initially.
The World Food Programme had previously ruled out humanitarian air drops in Syria due to the complexities of obtaining use of airspace, organising distribution on the ground, and finding suitable drop zones.
The UK government also said air drops were ""high risk and should only be considered as a last resort when all other means have failed"".
But Egeland said the strategy was the only way to feed people in Deir al-Zour.
""It is either air drops or nothing. Air drops are a desperate measure in desperate times,"" he told Reuters.
Speaking after a meeting of the 17-member International Syria Support Group (ISSG), he also said that UN aid was expected to reach all of Syria's 18 besieged areas within a week.
The UN believes more than 480,000 Syrians are living in besieged areas, with four million more people in so-called ""hard-to-reach"" areas.
All parties to the conflict are believed to have used siege warfare - where military forces surround an area and cut off essential supplies - in breach of international law.
On Wednesday, aid trucks reached rebel-held Muadhamiya and Madaya, near Damascus, and pro-government northern villages of Foah and Kefraya. Another town, Zabadani, was reached later.
The supplies, which included some medical supplies, are expected to last for about a month.
The deliveries were part of an agreement approved by the ISSG that world powers hope will lead to a ""cessation of hostilities"" by Friday.
The agreement does not apply to the fight against IS or al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate, and offensives by Syrian government forces and Kurdish militia fighters on rebel-held areas of the northern province of Aleppo have dimmed hopes of a truce.
A new report from humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) says 1.9 million people are under siege in Syria. It said data from hospitals and clinics it supports recorded 154,647 war-injured people and 7,009 war dead in 2015, 30 to 40 percent of whom were women and children.
The data, MSF said, showed ""civilians and civilian areas continued to be devastated"" by the conflict.

""There was no animosity against those candidates who were standing.

Lib Dem councillor Richard Kemp, who represents Church ward, said his party would come back from the brink.

35641061,"It also says professions like politics and the law continue to be dominated by privately educated Oxbridge graduates.
The Trust said a child's chances of reaching the top still came down to their schooling and contacts.
The government said the state sector was increasingly matching the private sector in terms of academic attainment.
Researchers for the Trust, which campaigns for greater social mobility, looked at the educational backgrounds of more than 1,200 people, working in high positions in medicine, the law, the military, journalism, politics, the civil service, business, film and pop music.
They also looked at Nobel Prize-winners.
The report - Leading People 2016 - found that more than two in five (42%) of British Bafta winners went to a private school, compared with around a fifth (19%) of those who have been awarded a Brit music award.
Also, two-thirds (67%) of British Oscar winners were privately educated, among them Eddie Redmayne, who went to Eton, and Kate Winslet, who studied at Redroofs Theatre School.
The Sutton Trust suggested the successful state-funded BRIT school in Croydon, which counts Adele and Jessie J among its former pupils, may be one reason why the proportion of state-educated top music stars is higher.
The research found that three-quarters (74%) of the UK's top judges went to a fee-paying school, and nearly eight in 10 (78%) went on to Oxford or Cambridge University.
Among top military personnel, some seven in 10 (71%) were educated in the private sector, although just 14% were Oxbridge educated.
Slightly more than half of leading print journalists and solicitors (51% each) attended fee-paying schools.
Just over half (54%) of these journalists attended Oxford or Cambridge, along with 55% of solicitors and 51% of the senior civil servants included in the study.
In politics, half the Cabinet were privately educated (including old Etonian Prime Minister David Cameron) compared with 13% of the shadow cabinet, and around a third (32%) of MPs.
The current Cabinet does have fewer former independent school pupils than the coalition cabinet of 2010, the report notes, but slightly more than Tony Blair's post-election Cabinet in 2005.
Just under half (47%) of the current cabinet are Oxbridge graduates, along with 32% of the shadow cabinet.
The trust said that of the country's top doctors, 61% were educated at independent schools, nearly one-quarter at grammar schools (22%) and the remainder (16%) at comprehensives.
The private school sector educates 7% of the population.
""The top of many of the UK's most prestigious professions remain disproportionately constituted by those with elite educational and socio-economic backgrounds,"" the study says.
Sutton Trust research fellow Dr Philip Kirby, who wrote the report, said: ""Young people from more advantaged backgrounds often have broader professional social networks, which can be used to access certain jobs, as well as parents who might be more able to support them through unpaid internships, which are increasingly important for career development.""
Chairman of the Sutton Trust Sir Peter Lampl said: ""Our research shows that your chances of reaching the top in so many areas of British life are very much greater if you went to an independent school.
""As well as academic achievement, an independent education tends to develop essential skills such as confidence, articulacy and team work which are vital to career success.
""The key to improving social mobility at the top is to open up independent schools to all pupils based on merit not money as demonstrated by our successful Open Access scheme, as well as support for highly able students in state schools.""
A  spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""Thanks to our reforms - which are underpinned by a total commitment to social justice - 1.4 million more pupils and counting are being taught in good or outstanding state schools than in 2010.
""As the independent Good Schools Guide has recognised - the state sector is increasingly matching the private sector in terms of academic attainment and learning environment.
""University entrants are at an all-time high, with rising numbers of children from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university and the number of disadvantaged students attending Russell Group universities doubling since 2010.
""We are determined to spread this educational excellence everywhere, extending true social mobility for all. We are continuing the pupil premium at current rates for the duration of this parliament.""","Leading British actors are more than twice as likely as stars in the music industry to have attended fee-paying schools, the Sutton Trust says."
40303979,"Many larger firms offer to ""match"" additional pension saving by their employees, by adding a contribution when workers save more.
But insurer Royal London said that many workers were unaware of the option, and failed to take advantage.
This could make a difference of hundreds of pounds in retirement income, it said.
Despite having to make a number of assumptions in calculations, Royal London has estimated that an estimated £2bn of employer pension contributions would be available if workers took up the option of saving to a maximum rather than minimum level.
It estimated that 3.2 million workers could receive an extra £650 per year each.
That would mean somebody on average earnings who chose to take up an additional 3% matched contribution to their pension pot would receive a retirement income of £22,500 rather than £19,050, thanks to the extra contribution and tax relief.
The Nationwide Building Society has changed its default level to a maximum, rather than a minimum contribution. Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and now director of policy and Royal London, said more could be done to make workers at other businesses aware that their employer might add to their pension if they were willing to contribute at a higher level.
""At a time when money is tight for many people and pay rises may be limited, getting your employer to contribute more to your pension can be a very cost-effective strategy,"" he said.
""When individuals are thinking about where to put their money to get the best return, the chance to more than double your money through an employer contribution and tax relief from the government takes a lot of beating.""
Graham Vidler, director of external affairs at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, said; ""If your employer offers a workplace pension, you should certainly consider joining and putting in as much as possible as if you don't you will miss out on free money in the form of employer contributions as well as the tax relief.
""This research highlights how much UK employees could be missing out on each year. It is also vitally important that people start saving into a pension as soon as possible as the longer you save, the bigger your final pot is likely to be and the more you can benefit from your employers 'matching' contributions.""","Workers are missing out on pension top-ups from their employers by only saving at a minimum level, research suggests."

Mr Livingstone has been suspended from Labour for his comments saying Adolf Hitler had supported Zionism. Mr Jones has called for the former mayor to be expelled from the party altogether.
The Welsh Labour leader said: ""It was planned he was going to come. We all saw what happened yesterday with Ken Livingstone, he is dealing with that in London, so it's just not possible.""
The decision not to proceed with the visit took place after ""discussions between the two offices"", Mr Jones said, adding that ""given all the publicity yesterday it would detract from our campaign today"".

Analysis by BBC Wales political editor Nick Servini
Senior Welsh Labour figures are putting a brave face on things but behind the scenes there is barely concealed irritation at the way the headlines have been dominated by further question marks over the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.
The party has been effective so far in running a Jeremy Corbyn-free campaign. The UK leader has not been to Wales of late and there has been little mention of Westminster politics by Labour candidates so far.
There is a reason for this - Jeremy Corbyn plays badly on the doorstep with plenty of voters in key marginal seats.
Carwyn Jones says fewer and fewer people have been mentioning him, which may be a reflection of the success Labour have had in largely keeping him out of the assembly campaign.
Whether they like it or not, Labour's internal divisions at a UK level are back out in the open and it is something they are going to have to deal with as we head into the final weekend of the campaign.
Commenting earlier on Friday on reports Welsh Labour had asked Mr Corbyn not to visit Wales, former Welsh Secretary Lord Hain said: ""Given what's happening in London, it's sensible we concentrate on what's going on in Wales.""
Labour was a ""proud anti-racist party"", he told BBC Radio Wales, saying the Livingstone controversy was ""an aberration"".
Newport West Labour MP Paul Flynn rejected the idea Mr Livingstone was anti-Semitic.
He said there was a ""misunderstanding"" over the comments and denied there was any ""crisis"" in the party.
""The Labour Party has been friends with Israel and with Jews forever,"" he told BBC Radio Cymru.

She never quite got Scotland.  However, Margaret Thatcher is not alone among Westminster leaders in that regard.
For the most part, she was adored by her party in Scotland, just as in England.
But, even as they worshipped, quite a few Scottish Tories fretted that her politics would prove particularly divisive north of the border and thus electorally unpopular.

""Today, however, the proper reaction should be respect and condolences to her family.""
Ms Davidson praised Lady Thatcher's policies, including extending the right for people to buy their council house.
Ruth Davidson said: ""She defended Britain's sovereignty, helped win the cold war, empowered thousands to own their own home by democratising property ownership and smashed the glass ceiling.
""My thoughts are with her family.""
Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: ""I came into politics to fight the ideology and values of Margaret Thatcher which I believe damaged our country. But today is not a day to debate that.
""Today is a day to offer the deepest condolences to her family, friends and all who loved her.
""No-one can deny she made a deep mark on the history of this country.""
Under Baroness Thatcher's leadership the Conservative government implemented social and economic policies which were unpopular in Scotland, including the Community Charge or poll tax.
The introduction of the poll tax, which took place in Scotland in 1989 - 12 months before the rest of the UK, led to widespread protests and a lasting animosity towards the Conservative party in Scotland.
Sir Malcolm Rifkind, served as Secretary of State for Scotland in her cabinet, said many of her major achievements also continued to be reflected in public opinion.
He told BBC Scotland: ""In a sense what made her so magnificent is occasionally what made her a very difficult and controversial character because she had very strong views, she put them forward uncompromisingly.
""She didn't mind being challenged, indeed she would listen with great care if she thought the person challenging her actually knew what they were talking about and she could change her mind and opinions, but only on the basis of solid evidence and solid argument.
""She would not be influenced by the fact it would be unpopular. That she despised, as well as disapproved of.""
Baroness Thatcher's economic policy was also praised by Iain McMillan, director of CBI Scotland. He said: ""It is all too easy to overlook the dreadful state that the UK economy was in at that time and the challenges that she and her government faced.
""Through sheer tenacity and immense courage, Margaret Thatcher changed the UK economy for the better and laid the ground for years of greatly improved economic performance.""
The former chief political correspondent of the BBC, John Sergeant said: ""It's interesting that her two election campaigns that really mattered were 1979 and '83 - both of them started in Perth. That's where she made her opening speech.
""So Scotland did matter to her a great deal, but she was always rather dismayed that she didn't do very well in Scotland.
""Her heart used to sink travelling north, as it did for Tony Blair. Once the poll tax was hung round her neck, and of course the miners dispute and everything else, she was always an amazingly divisive figure in Scotland and Tory fortunes north of the border never recovered from that early period.""","Scottish politicians have paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first woman Prime Minister, who has died."

40196386,"The Space Vision app gets children to tap increasing faint black and white squares on a grey background to make aliens pop up and make a noise.
Their ability to keep track of the squares can be used to screen for vision problems and developers hope it will ease the burden on the NHS.
The co-founder of Vision Games, said it was an ""exciting prospect"".
Luke Anderson started the company with Dr Stephanie Campbell with support from the Centre of Excellence in Mobile and Emerging Technologies at the University of South Wales.
Early tests picked up vision problems, such as lazy eye, in children as young as two.
Mr Anderson said: ""We're living in a time where there's increased pressure on the health service and if you can get patients monitoring their own vision at home that takes stress off hospital systems.""
The app, once publically available, would initially flag up any vision problems it identified to the user and advise them if they needed to make an appointment with a GP or optician.
In the long-run, Mr Anderson said the data could be synced with family GPs so doctors could access the information to make an assessment.
Mr Anderson, a consultant eye surgeon at Cwm Taf University Health Board, said the idea came from the ""extremely difficult"" experience of trying to assess children's eyesight using charts.
They often struggled to get young children to sit still, so developing a game children would take an interest in helps them gather more data.
Areas of vision tested include colour, motion, black on white and differentiating between shades of grey.
The app is about to undergo larger clinical tests after a small initial run, but Mr Anderson said if everything went to plan, it could be downloadable within 18 months.
Mr Anderson said getting children to sit still ""was still a problem,"" adding: ""But, looking at my children, the time when they're quiet is when they're sitting there on a tablet or a phone.
""So we just naturally took the science and tried to implement it on that platform. The use of technology for efficiency within the NHS is an exciting prospect.""",A game for tablets is being developed in Wales which parents can use to test their children's eyesight at home.
11876532,"Why? Because of compound interest.
When you save money, it earns interest.
The lump sum grows from interest being added every year or every month.
Interest added on top of that interest is known as ""compound interest"" - and means that the longer you save, the better off you are.
So people who leave it late - like Dave in the example above - have compounded their financial problems when it comes to cashing in their savings.
But it is worth remembering that pensions usually depend on the success of investments which, unlike savings, do not guarantee a set level of interest.",Saving a small amount of money regularly from when you start work will leave you better off than saving a bigger amount in later life.

It revealed that it delivered 14,820 cars in the first quarter, falling short of the expected 16,000.
It comes after the firm revealed that its new Model 3 car already has 276,000 pre-orders.
The carmaker said that it had delivered 12,420 Model S sedans and 2,400 Model X SUVs in the first quarter of 2016.
In a statement, Tesla added that its Q1 delivery count was ""impacted by severe Model X supplier parts shortages in January and February that lasted much longer than initially expected"".
It said that once ""issues were resolved"", production and delivery rates ""improved dramatically"".
""By the last full week of March, the build rate rose to 750 Model X vehicles per week, however many of these vehicles were built too late to be delivered to their owners before end of the quarter.""
It was frank about the reasons for the delay: ""The root causes of the parts shortages were: Tesla's hubris in adding far too much technology to the Model X in version one, insufficient supplier capability validation and Tesla not having broad enough capability to manufacture the parts in-house.""
Back in February, Elon Musk admitted that the car had been ""over-engineered"".
The shortage involved about six out of the 8,000 parts that go into the Model X but Tesla did not specify which ones.
It has raised doubts about how prepared Tesla will be to deliver its new Model 3 car which was announced to much fanfare last week.
The basic model will sell for $35,000 (£24,423) - less than half the cost of Tesla's previous models - and has a range of at least 215 miles per charge.
The car is due to go on sale in late 2017 and customers must put down a $1,000 (£704) deposit. It can be ordered in advance to dozens of countries, including the UK, Brazil, India, China and New Zealand.
Mr Musk has revealed that the company is focusing on ramping up productions and will eventually need to build a factory in Europe to satisfy demand.
Stephanie Brinley, a senior analyst with research firm IHS, said that it was crucial that it gets production of the new vehicle right.
""Given its history of missed deadlines, this one needs to be met, to earn the faith of consumers and investors alike,"" she said.
Last year Tesla posted a net loss of $889m (£620m) for 2015, partly because of the large sum it spent on research and development.",Tesla Motors has revealed that supplies of its Model X electric car have been impacted by a shortage of parts meaning delays for some who have ordered them.

Kieran Duffy grabbed Monaghan's third goal as his side bossed the game to book a place in Monday's Round 3B draw.
Wexford had three players sent-off in the second half, as well as Kelly.
Kelly and Ciaran Lyng were dismissed for two yellow card offences, while Adrian Flynn was flashed a black card four minutes later, with Wexford having used their six substitutes.
Substitute John Leacy was shown a straight red card moments later.
Monaghan will be joined in Monday morning's qualifier draw by Tipperary, conquerors of Cavan, Carlow, who saw off Leitrim, and Armagh, who saw off Westmeath.
The match pitted Wexford manager Seamus McEnaney against his native county, whom he guided to two Ulster finals in 2007 and 2010 during a six-year tenure from 2005 to 2010.
In his first season in charge of Wexford, McEnaney saw his side lose to Carlow in the first round of the Leinster SFC, before edging out Limerick by a point in the first round of the qualifiers.
Monaghan, who saw off Cavan in Ulster, before losing to Down, made four changes to their starting line-up prior to throw-in, with Dessie Mone, Gavin Doogan, Shane Carey and Dermot Malone replacing Vinny Corey, Darren Hughes, Kieran Duffy and Conor McCarthy.
From the outset, the Ulster county appeared determined to ensure that there would be no repeat of their surprise three-point demise to Longford at the same stage of the All-Ireland series last year.
Jack McCarron played a part in fashioning both first-half goals, Kelly firing a left-foot strike into the bottom corner in the seventh minute and midfielder O'Connell finding the back of the net in the 26th.
A black card for Conor McManus did little to dent Monaghan's superiority as they built up an 11-point advantage at the interval.

34508711,"Prof Deaton, 69, is currently professor of economics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, in New Jersey.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said that Prof Deaton's work has transformed several fields of economics.
More specifically, the organisation said he had made an impact on economic theory, and on the practical application of data to investigate poverty, and devise economic policy.
The headline to the statement from the academy that announced that Prof Deaton was its 2015 winner said: ""Consumption, great and small"". What does this mean?
Consumption, to an economist, means spending on goods and services by individuals and households.
Understanding it means looking at how consumers allocate spending between different things, how they divide their incomes between spending and saving, and how these patterns vary over time.
The ""great and small"" in the academy's headline reflects Prof Deaton's analysis of consumer spending across a whole economy, and at the level of the individual and the household.
One theme that runs through the academy's analysis of his work is the extensive use of data on spending taken from household surveys. Previously, economists worked much more from aggregate data for the whole economy.
This focus enabled Prof Deaton to produce a theoretical approach that was more consistent with the fluctuations in consumer spending that he found.
A more arcane achievement was in developing (with another economist John Muellbauer) a theory of demand for goods and services - how people allocate their spending between different products - that was motivated by problems in earlier analysis.
Their system, and subsequent improvements by other researchers, ""has had an immense impact in academia as well as being greatly influential in practical policy evaluation"".
Prof Deaton has been an influential figure in development economics. The academy describes him as an important driving force in the transformation of this area of economics - in moving from aggregate data to household surveys.
To take one example - his research shed light on the question of whether rising incomes do lead to more calories being consumed, in other words to reducing malnutrition.
His work suggests that it does - so encouraging economic growth can help tackle malnutrition. If that were not the case it would be an argument for reorienting policy towards direct food aid.
In addition to the greater recognition of his work, and the further respect of his peers, Prof Deaton receives a financial price of 8m Swedish krona ($966,000; Â£630,000).
Born in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh, Prof Deaton attended Fettes College, a private school in the city, before going on to study at Cambridge University.
After teaching at Cambridge and the University of Bristol, he continued his economics career in the US.
He holds both British and American citizenship.
Unlike the other five annual Nobel prizes, the economics one was not established by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, although like the Physics and Chemistry prizes it is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
Instead it was set up by Sweden's central bank in 1968 as a memorial to Mr Nobel, who died in 1896.
Its official title is the Riksbank's Prize in Economic Sciences.",The 2015 Nobel Prize for Economics has been awarded to Scottish-born economist Angus Deaton.
35280955,"Oxfordshire County Council spent £25m in 2014-15 on direct payments to support about 1,770 social care users.
But an internal review has found ""insufficient controls in place"" to ensure money was not being misused.
Payments were spent on utility bills, household repairs, food and parents paying themselves high salaries.
Updates on this story and more from Oxfordshire
The report added: ""The deputy director has confirmed these example items may not be relevant to meet assessed eligible need.""
The  authority's website said direct payments were intended to pay for ""a variety of care and support services"".
It said: ""Unless there are exceptional circumstances, you can't use the money to employ a close relative or person living in your home.
""You must not use your direct payment to pay for [...] items such as food, drinks, utilities, gifts or for other everyday items.""
A report to the authority's Audit and Governance Committee said some expenditure had not been approved ""but was not stopped nor recovered"".
It added the current system ""does not adequately clarify what is or isn't acceptable"" and ""does not require evidence to support payments"".
""Finance queries had gone unanswered and also questionable expenditure not challenged,"" it said.
Labour councillor and committee member John Tanner said he would be pressing for more investigation into direct payments, because they were ""wide open to abuse"".
A council spokesman said investigations were continuing into the possible misuse of ""a very small proportion"" of the £25m budget.
He said steps would be taken to recover any misspent money and a new direct payment policy was being developed to make it clear how it should be used.

32825242,"The alcohol is flowing, the skirts short: this is the epitome of Turkey's most liberal, Westernised city - and my first stop as I travel across the country ahead of Turkey's upcoming election.
""You have pepper spray, you have tear gasâ€¦but we're still freeâ€¦this country is ours,"" the fans sing.
On the stage at Izmir's seafront is Duman, one of Turkey's best-loved rock bands. As they belt out tunes about the anti-government protests of 2013, the thousands-strong crowd goes wild.
""When I was studying in Poland, people there thought Turkey is a heavily Muslim country; that the women are all covered and men have four wives,"" laughs Serbay Kos, a volleyball trainer.
""But Izmir isn't like that - we're like Europe and America.""
He takes a swig of beer as the song changes.
""I'm worried that this government is trying to make Turkey into a more Muslim country, like Iraq or Syria - but we want to be free.""
It is a sentiment you hear frequently in this relaxed, coastal city - Turkey's third largest.
Izmir has always looked across the Aegean to Europe; its Greek heritage and affluent bon-viveur feel shaping its politics.
The centre-left Republican People's Party, or CHP, has its stronghold here - Izmir is known as the ""CHP's castle"".
Staunchly secular, it is the party of modern Turkey's founding father, Kemal Ataturk.
In the last election, the CHP took 44% of the vote in Izmir - more than double its national share. And it is aiming higher for the poll on 7 June.
Many here fear the growing conservatism of the current government.
Under the 12-year rule of the Islamist-rooted AK Party, constitutionally-secular Turkey has fundamentally changed.
There is now a push to raise a ""pious generation"" - in the words of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - and CHP-dominated Izmir appears increasingly isolated.
But in the Bostanli market of Izmir, local CHP candidate Zeynep Altiok is full of confidence.
We stroll through the rows of artichokes, succulent tomatoes and oranges.
These are rich pickings for the customers - and for campaigning politicians, as she secures vital votes.
""Turkey is a big mosaic,"" Ms Altiok tells me, as she is handed a slice of melon by one supporter.
""There should be no extremes. Neighbours live beside each other, one wearing a headscarf, one without - that's what we must do.
""But the government labels you: you're either with them or against them. We have to break this.""
Warm words, but the CHP's history isn't exactly inclusive. For decades it embodied old-school nationalism, taking a hard line towards Turkey's minorities, especially the Kurds.
And it is still seen by critics as the party of the so-called ""white Turks"", the wealthier, Westernised parts of society.
But Ms Altiok insists the party has changed.
""It's now totally modern. We don't discriminate. Our approach is to bring freedom for everybody in this country.""
At the top of its agenda is the issue of women's rights.
The government has constantly stressed its vision of stay-at-home mothers, urging three children per family. Last year, the deputy prime minister told women not to laugh in public; the president recently insisted that men and women were ""not made equal"".
Is Turkey increasingly misogynistic?
The problem with insulting Erdogan
On the corniche in Izmir, female defiance is clear.
Hundreds have joined an all-women cycling group to promote empowerment as well as concern for the environment.
Some wear short, brightly-coloured dresses, others have flowers in their hair.
""The Turkey I want has respect for all citizens - men and women - giving everyone the same opportunities,"" says Pinar Pinzuti, pedalling along the bay as the afternoon sun glints on the water.
""Turkey needs to change: we need a country with allies, with respect for opposite opinions - and with democracy. This is not democracy any more.""
Izmir's resistance to the growing advance of religion here is closely tied to its history.
It was the city most associated with Turkey's war of independence from 1919, where Ataturk's army rose up against the Allied troops.
And it was the place that sealed Turkey's victory in 1922 when the Turkish army recaptured the city.
Hundreds of thousands of Greeks and Armenians were killed or driven out, a fire engulfing their parts of the city.
While Greece still mourns its loss, Turkey sees it as a nationalist triumph.
And so reverence for Ataturk - and his free, secular Turkish identity - is at its height here.

Figures show in the Lothians 15% of children had to wait more than a year.
Less than half of the 665 children referred were seen within the target of 18-weeks.
Two years ago the Scottish government set a target for Mental Health services that 90% young people should be seen within 18 weeks.
The figures for treatment from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) relate to the period between October and December 2016.
A spokesperson for the Scottish Children's Services Coalition, a network of support groups,  said: ""The figures from NHS Lothian indicating that more than half of those who started their treatment between October and December had been waiting more than the Scottish government target of 18 weeks is clearly disappointing.
""In addition, of the 101 children and young people in Scotland who had been waiting for more than a year before they started treatment, these almost all relate to NHS Lothian.
""We know that half of all diagnosable mental health problems start before the age of 14 and 75% by the age of 21.
""As such it is vitally important that an action plan is put in place for NHS Lothian, radically improving mental health services and increasing investment in these, with an overall aim of ensuring that children and young people get the help they need, when they need it.
""A target of 18-weeks is in itself still far too long.
""Families usually experience months of waiting even before a referral to CAMHS.
""The consequent delay in diagnosis and appropriate support can lead to a crisis situation for the child or young person concerned, as well as for their family, and the need for costly extra resources to address this.
""We hope that NHS Lothian takes account of these figures and takes urgent action to address this matter.""

39292599,"But when she was physically attacked in January, while walking in Georgetown, the South American country's capital, she decided to seek justice.
""The young man came up to me and asked if it was me who disrespected him the other night,"" she said, in reference to a previous argument with her alleged assailant.
""And he joock [stabbed] me to my neck with scissors. I fell to the ground and when he left, I ran away. Then he came back with some glass bottles and pelted me down.""
""It happens a lot here in Guyana to transgender women,"" she added. ""We live in a very homophobic society.""
Ms Trotman reported the matter to the police and the case went to Georgetown Magistrates Court.
But seeking justice as a transgender woman is not easy in Guyana due to a colonial-era law, now 124 years old, that criminalises cross-dressing.
Guyanese Summary Jurisdiction Act
On her first day in the courtroom, Ms Trotman was told by the presiding magistrate to ""dress like a man"" at her next court date.
When she returned to court on 2 March to hear the final verdict, she defiantly wore a blue top and a long, patterned skirt.
This time, Magistrate Dylon Bess refused her entry, citing ""inappropriate dress"".
""I felt really bad because the magistrate ordered me out of the court and he literally tried the case without me,"" Ms Trotman told the BBC.
The case was dismissed and, with Ms Trotman not allowed inside the court, she only learned of the decision when her alleged attacker shared the news upon leaving the courtroom.
Magistrate Bess defended his demand that Ms Trotman dress in male clothes.
He said that while it was ""a preference and not a requirement"" that transgender women dress as men in his courtroom, ""sometimes persons commit offences dressed as males and then when they appear in court dressed as a female it can have implications for how a victim can identify his or her accuser, or vice versa"".
He also said that it would be up to parliament to abolish Guyana's law criminalising cross-dressing and not a court of law.
The managing director of Guyana's Society Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination (SASOD), Joel Simpson, strongly disagrees.
""It's really a dereliction of duty for Magistrate Bess to say that parliament has to change the law,"" he said.
""While he is a magistrate, not a judge, the court should not be applying an unjust, unconstitutional law... Where there's conflict, the constitution prevails.""
A former president of the Guyana Bar Association, Ronald Burch-Smith, also questioned the continued application of the law.
""There's a legitimate concern when it comes to things like crime and robbery, that persons dressed in disguise might take advantage of female clothing,"" he said.
""But in the [cases] that have come up so far that has never been an issue. It's taking advantage of an already oppressed minority.
""I think the courts should take the lead in recognising that these things are irrelevant to justice.""
Opposition to the cross-dressing law was sparked in 2009 when transgender activist Quincy McEwan and six others were arrested and fined for loitering and wearing female attire.
In protest, Ms McEwan founded Guyana Trans United (GTU) and in 2010 launched a Supreme Court challenge against the cross-dressing law, in partnership with sister organisation SASOD and the University of the West Indies' Rights Advocacy Project, U-RAP.
When the case came before the court in 2013, Guyana's then-chief justice, Ian Chang, ruled that cross-dressing was legal unless done for an ""improper purpose"".
He did not say what constituted an improper purpose.
Seeking clarification, Ms McEwan and her supporters took the matter to Guyana's Court of Appeal, denouncing the law as ""discriminatory"" and ""unconstitutional"".
But late in February they received the news that their appeal had been dismissed and Mr Chang's ruling upheld.
Although frustrated with the decision, GTU and SASOD are determined to press on.
""Our next step is to continue to have protests, let our voices be heard and then to get a petition before parliament,"" Ms McEwan said.
""And we're not stopping there. We're going to appeal our matter before the Caribbean Court of Justice.""
If the Caribbean Court of Justice upholds their case, Guyana will have to amend its laws. ""That's the highest court so we will have to follow the decision,"" said Attorney General Basil Williams.
LGBT activists will likely face opposition along the way, particularly from religious pressure groups.
""The Church is one factor in all of this,"" said the Attorney General. ""But as time goes by everything becomes more enlightened.""
Ms Trotman is hoping change comes soon. Without the money to appeal Magistrate Bess's decision, she said: ""I finished with the case. It's sad but what you can do? Certain laws need to be changed. It's very discriminating to us here in Guyana. When you're one thing and people want you to be something else.""","As a transgender woman living in Guyana, Petronella Trotman has grown accustomed to violence and daily abuse on the streets."

The explosion occurred in the Faj Attan area of the capital, near the presidential compound.
A Saudi-led coalition bombing campaign has been targeting Yemen's Shia Houthi rebels since late March.
Local resident Adel Mansour told Reuters news agency it was largest explosion in more than three weeks of bombing by the coalition.
""My children are terrified and one of my relatives fainted because of the force of the blast.""
Meanwhile, a BBC correspondent in the contested port city of Aden says its hospitals lack the supplies to treat patients.
Orla Guerin says medical teams in the city are complaining that patients are dying for lack of equipment. They have appealed for more antibiotics and bandages.
The Houthi rebels and their allies have been trying to capture Aden for weeks but have been held back by the air strikes and by forces of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, who has fled Yemen for Saudi Arabia.
In a televised address on Monday, rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said Yemenis would never give in to the Saudis' ""savage aggression"".
The blast in Sanaa followed an air strike that hit an Oxfam humanitarian store in Saada, a Houthi stronghold in the north of the country.
The charity condemned the strike, saying it had provided the co-ordinates of its warehouses to the Saudis.

33958860,"From her office near the Indonesian capital's landmark Hotel Indonesia roundabout, the 24-year-old needed to cover the 30km (19 miles) to Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in under an hour.
In a city notorious for its endless traffic jams it seemed impossible.
However, as Ms Hauser was travelling light, one of her colleagues suggested that she tried a new mobile phone-based motorcycle taxi service called Go-Jek.
Downloading the app, Ms Hauser used her smart phone to book and pay for a scooter to take her to the airport.
Within minutes a Go-Jek rider turned up, and she hopped on the back.
After a journey weaving around cars and lorries that perhaps wasn't suitable for those of a nervous disposition, Ms Hauser did indeed get to the airport on time.
""I was very content, and since then have become a regular Go-Jek customer,"" she says.
The brainchild of 30-year-old Indonesian entrepreneur Nadiem Makarim, the Go-Jek app has been downloaded more than 500,000 times since the service launched in Jakarta at the start of this year.
Mr Makarim claims that no other app in Indonesia has reached half a million downloads so quickly.
With no money spent on advertising, the success has solely come thanks to positive world of mouth.
While motorcycle taxis, known locally as ojek, have long been a popular form of transport in Jakarta, Go-Jek is the first attempt to introduce a hi-tech booking system and guaranteed service standards.
Outside of Go-Jek, ojek riders congregate on street corners, and are not officially registered. Payments have to be made in cash, and prices are a matter of negotiation.
By contract, Go-Jek recruits and trains its staff, who get uniforms, helmets, and a smart phone on which they manage their pick ups.
The company also sets standard fare levels, and provides its drivers with insurance.
Go-Jek now has no less than 10,000 riders on its books, based not just in Jakarta, but also across the cities of Bandung and Surabaya, and the island of Bali.
The company makes its money by taking a 20% commission from each journey.
Mr Makarim has been a regular ojek user since his early 20s, but he admits that his childhood journeys were often a lot more luxurious.
Born into an affluent Indonesian family, he would be taken to primary school in Jakarta in a chauffeur-driven car.
Mr Markarim was then educated overseas, attending high schools in both New York and Singapore, before going to Brown University in the US state of Rhode Island to study international relations.
This was followed by getting a master of business administration degree from Harvard University in Boston.
Returning to Indonesia to work as a management consultant in Jakarta, the idea of creating Go-Jek came to him when he was speaking with his regular ojek rider.
Mr Markarim says: """"I asked him, 'how long do you work?'.
""The ojek driver said he normally works 14 hours a day.
""And, I also asked him how many orders he normally took in a day. He said about four or five, so it meant that for 70% to 75% of his work hours, he's not actually working, he just sits there waiting for customers.""
Realising that there was a problem of supply and demand, Mr Markarim realised that developing a phone app could better connect would-be passengers with ojek riders, and via versa.
He also decided that passengers would like to see an increased level of trust and accountability. Therefore the app allows customers to see the distance to their destination, and calculate the exact cost of the journey.
For each kilometre (0.6 miles) travelled with Go-Jek, customers are charged 4,000 rupiah (29 cents; 20p).
Mr Markarim also came up with the idea of utilising Go-Jek riders as a fleet of delivery men, and even personal shoppers.
So instead of just using Go-Jek to transport themselves, customers can book a Go-Jek driver to collect a takeaway for them, or even do a food shop.
Mr Markarim says this gives the riders a new revenue steam, especially in times of the day when demand for passengers is low.
""This way, ojek drivers do not just earn money during rush hours,"" he says.
To launch Go-Jek Mr Markarim quit a secure full-time job. Despite having recently married at the time, he felt it was a risk worth taking.
With the business proving a big success so far, he is proud of what he is achieving.
""We only live once,"" he says. ""What do I want to tell to my grandkids about what I have done? Is it that I've made money or invented something that changed an industry forever?
""For me what I have been doing is a lot more than just making money. This is about what I leave as my legacy when I'm no longer around in this world.""
Mr Markarim, who has since accepted investment from friends and other investors, now plans to expand his business operations by releasing a sister app called Go-Truk.
Go-Truk aims to show which lorries in Jakarta have spare space, which can then be more easily hired out.","With Jakarta's traffic gridlocked in the middle of a Friday afternoon rush hour, German expat Jana Hauser thought she had little chance of catching her flight."

E. L. James's personal story has become a tantalising fantasy for aspiring authors. But one that technology and social media are making increasingly realisable.
""There was a time when self-publishing was equated with vanity,"" explains John Bond, co-founder of Whitefox, one of several new companies helping 'amateur' authors publish professionally on platforms like Amazon Kindle, Google Play, Apple's iBook Store or Kobo.
""Because of the digital revolution, democratisation has happened. It's almost as if the writer has become his own entrepreneur around the publication process.""
In their competition to get noticed, self-publishers are proving willing to take risks.
Andy Weir's The Martian eventually went on to become a Hollywood blockbuster. But the story was originally published chapter by chapter on the author's blog for free.
This turned out to be great exposure and it became a huge hit as an audiobook, e-book and physical book.
""There was an adversarial attitude between mainstream publishing houses and self publishers a few years ago,"" says Mr Bond, ""but I think that's changed dramatically.""
He attributes this to traditional publishers' new-found admiration for the self publishers' social media skills, which have helped them find new readers without the benefit of expensive marketing campaigns.
Lawyer-turned-author Mark Dawson, for example, uses his website and Facebook page to give out free copies of his thrillers and curates 'Readers' Groups'. Online conversations help him establish a closer relationship with his readers encouraging them to come back for subsequent publications.
Another thriller writer Joanna Penn has bolstered her following by helping others to self-publish through her website which explains how to go about self publishing. She also hosts a popular podcast interview series.
So-called ""Instapoets"" like New Zealander Lang Leav have built up huge followings on Instagram and Tumblr, publishing their work on these platforms, before securing traditional publishing deals.
Douglas Wight has just completed his first self-published book and has a more cautionary tale to tell.
The former News of the World tabloid journalist set up his own company to self-publish a biography of pop diva Rita Ora, in the run up to Christmas.
He and his co-author opted to sell the e-book version on Amazon, but also took the added risk of organising their own hardback print-run.
Self-publishing wasn't as straight-forward as he had hoped.
""You have control of what you are doing, but it's not for everyone,"" warns Mr Wight. ""It's a lot of work and a huge learning curve.""
That work includes satisfying all the different formatting requirements of the various e-book outlets, organising cover illustrations and marketing, all while bearing the financial risk of the whole enterprise, explains Mr Wight.
That said, he feels his gamble paid off.
The hardback version has sold more than 3,000 copies and performed better than expected on Kindle.
He has covered his costs and is now hoping to begin a new chapter of profitability.
But what if it is not just readers you are after, but cash rewards?
Orna Ross, founder of the Alliance of Independent Authors, believes the hard work of self-publishing can pay off.
In the past traditional publishers would give the author around 10%, she says, negotiating a tough contract as they were the only route to market, with advances that were getting smaller.
Amazon may be seen in a negative light for its impact on the high street, but for self-publishers its market disruption is largely welcomed, she says.
Kindle Direct Publishing can give authors up to 70% of the purchase price. It allows authors to retain copyright and gives them a non-exclusive deal.
In the US, the most mature market, independent authors are now collectively earning more from e-books than authors handled by the so-called Big Five publishers, according to advocacy website Author Earnings.
However, they also charge roughly half the amount for their e-books, and there are many more of them.
Generous profit margins don't mean so much if you are selling cheap and struggling to sell at all in a crowded market.
Philip Jones, editor of The Bookseller magazine, believes it's a lot harder to make money from self-publishing now that the Kindle-inspired gold rush has petered out.
""Smart, entrepreneurial authors"" could use clever marketing on social media to get their e-books into the Top Ten charts, timing it to sell enough books over Christmas to make a tidy profit.
But that trick is harder to pull off when there are so many e-books out there, he argues.
""I do worry that as the market has slowed so the number of sharks willing to take money from authors has grown,"" warns Mr Jones.
""Publishing, when it works properly, should be about moving money towards authors.""
The exact number of self-publishers and their impact on publishing is surprisingly hard to pin down.
Amazon does not disclose its e-book sales, which are worth more than a billion dollars annually in the US alone, but remain a comparatively small part of its retail empire.
Author Earnings, which scrapes public data from Amazon's bestseller lists for its analytics calculates that in the US, the amount of money spent on self-published books went up from around $510m in 2014 to $600m in 2015.
""E-book sales are like dark matter,"" says Michael Tamblyn, chief executive of e-book retailer, Kobo, though he is willing to volunteer some information.
""For us, 12% of the books we sell globally are self-published.""

Moray SNP MP Angus Robertson had initially written directly to Halfords chief executive Jill McDonald.
He said: ""Halfords' decision to quickly review and change their delivery charges policy so that a flat rate now applies regardless of where the customer lives is a very welcome change of heart.

The Welsh Government said it was in the process of reviewing its policy ""to make sure it is as strong as possible"".
Bullies Out founder Linda James said: ""We need to have that consistent definition of what exactly bullying is.
""We know that some schools are really proactive with their anti-bullying and they deal with it - but we also hear the stories that others are not.

Earlier this month, the funeral of 14-year-old Nyah James from Swansea was held. Her mother, Dominique Williams claims she took her own life as a result of being bullied at school.
She said: ""It makes us feel terrible because we weren't there to stop it. To find out she was being bullied and going through such pain of her own and we didn't know nothing about it - that kills us every day.""

Nipsa employees are not permitted to become members of the union they work for, but the staff involved are members of another trade union, Unite.
Unite representative Kevin Kelly said it was a long-standing dispute and he accused Nipsa's governing general council of a ""failure to practice a standard of industrial relations that they would expect of their officials"".
""My members are disgusted that their employer, who routinely challenges poor industrial relations practice across Northern Ireland, is acting in a manner which no employer would dare,"" Mr Kelly said.

35979965,"He had month-long summer jobs there in 2009 and 2010, the EU Parliament said, without revealing his identity.
Sources, however, say he is Najim Laachraoui, one of the airport bombers.
The Belgian prime minister has defended his country's approach to fighting terror threats, insisting Belgium is not a ""failed state"".
Charles Michel said everyone in authority had to take a share of the blame for failings before and after 22 March.
The attacks by so-called Islamic State on a Brussels airport and metro station killed 32 people.
Laachraoui, already a major suspect on the run after the Paris attacks in November, was named as one of the two bombers who targeted Zaventem airport.
The EU Parliament said the cleaning firm had provided proof that the person hired had no criminal record at the time.
The BBC's James Reynolds in Brussels says the capital's metro and its airport are gradually reopening.
Mr Michel said 30 measures were being put place in Belgium, including a ban on pre-paid mobile phone cards.
""Our key message today is we return to normal life in Brussels and in Belgium,"" the Associated Press quoted him as telling reporters.
""When there is an attack like that of course that's a failure and nobody can deny this,"" Prime Minister Michel said.
""[But] I cannot accept the idea that we're a failed state.""
Belgium has been accused of taking an un-co-ordinated approach to terror threats because it has multiple institutions representing the country's complex linguistic and political makeup.
The Brussels region alone has six police zones.
According to Belgium's De Tijd newspaper, Mr Michel said it was ""short-sighted to say a unified police force could have prevented the attacks"".
He said there had been some successes like the recent arrest of the surviving suspect of the Paris attacks last November, Salah Abdeslam, adding it had taken 10 years to track down al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks in the US.
The prime minister told our correspondent that giving more capacity to Belgian's security services would be ""crucial for the next months to succeed"".
""This means more equipment but also more capacities for our intelligence services,"" he said.
He added that his country's geographical position meant that Belgium was a particular attraction for potential attackers.
""Belgium is a small country in the heart of Europe, it means that it is very easy to go to London, Paris etc,"" he said.
""It is an easy place to organise attacks in other countries of Europe. It means we have to work better with our partners, and we have to upgrade our capacities for security.""
The search for the 22 March attackers is not yet over as pictures taken at Zaventem airport show three men entering the terminal building with explosives.

40652544,"Henson was part of Wales' 2005 Six Nations Grand Slam team coached by Ruddock, kicking a famous match-winning penalty against England.
The back, 35, has returned to Wales for the first time since 2012 to play for the region Ruddock coached in 2003-04.
""Hopefully he can play, but also become the leadership figure at the Dragons I am sure he is capable of at this stage of his career,"" Ruddock said.
""He would still be very ambitious and want to prove he can still perform at the very highest level.
""I hope Gavin could reflect on his career, on what has worked for him and what hasn't.
""Some of those experiences that have been positive for him hopefully he can use those to help shape the way forward in the Dragons.""
Henson last played in Welsh domestic rugby for Cardiff Blues in 2012, after making his name with Swansea and the Ospreys between 2000 and 2009.
In between, Henson - who won 33 caps for Wales and one for the British and Irish Lions - has played club rugby for Saracens, Toulon, London Welsh, Bath and Bristol.
Ruddock's one season in charge of the Dragons was their most successful, and he hopes the Welsh Rugby Union's takeover of the region this summer will pay dividends.
""It was definitely time for a change and probably long overdue,"" Ruddock added.
""Since my time there the Dragons have huffed and puffed and not lived up to the standards we thought they were capable of.
""It sounds like the right things are being done with the [new] pitch coming in already, that sounds like a fantastic move.""
The Dragons also have a new head coach in former Ireland hooker Bernard Jackman.
""Bernard is a good young coach who had cut his teeth in France and in the All-Ireland League where I am currently coaching with Lansdowne,"" said Ruddock.
""He was with Clontarf and did well there.
""He's worked under a lot of good coaches during his time and would have had a good understanding of the game.""
Ruddock's son Rhys captained Ireland on their summer tour against USA and Japan, while his older son Ciaran is captain of All-Ireland side St Mary's College.
""That was a big day for him and the family to see Rhys captain Ireland,"" said Ruddock, whose wife Bernadette is Irish.
""Ciaran has just been made captain where he will be playing against my team, so that has become all of a sudden an even tougher job!""
After coaching stints in Wales, England and Ireland with international, regional, provincial and age-grade sides, Ruddock is settled in Dublin, guiding Lansdowne in the All-Ireland League and working part-time in private business.
""I have learned a lot of lessons along the way, good and bad and am trying to help a lot of youngsters in Lansdowne,"" said Ruddock.
""At 58 next month, I still think I am in my prime!
""What I love about the All-Ireland League is that you can go to places like Young Munster in Limerick and Cork Constitution and there is still that Munster v Leinster feel to it.
""There is relegation, play-offs, so everything is very competitive.

30112715,"BBC Radio Norfolk host Nick Conrad made the comment during a phone-in about the future of the former Sheffield United and Norwich City footballer.
Rape campaigners have condemned the remarks. Conrad has apologised.
A BBC spokesman said some of the 29-year-old presenter's comments were ""very ill-judged"".
During his programme on Monday, Conrad said: ""I think women need to be more aware of a man's sexual desire, that when you're in that position that you are about to engage in sexual activity, there's a huge amount of energy in the male body, there's a huge amount of will and intent, and it's very difficult for many men to say no when they are whipped up into a bit of a storm.
""It's the old adage about if you yank a dog's tail then don't be surprised when it bites you.""
He went on to suggest feminists who had ""hijacked"" or ""jumped on"" the argument ""neglect that very important part of the argument"".
""In their fury against men and masculinity they actually forget to stop and say if you tease, if you jump into bed naked with a man, if you give him all the signals and then he acts upon them, then you are partially responsible,"" he said.
""If you don't wish to give out the wrong signals it's best probably to keep your knickers on and not get into bed with him.""
Conrad added he needed to be ""careful"" about what he said because he did not ""want this to be explosive"".
""The onus has to be on the men.... if a woman says no and they persist then that's absolutely abhorrent,"" he said.
The BBC said Conrad had spoken to the charity End Violence Against Women Coalition during the programme and there had been no formal complaints.
""As part of a wide-ranging discussion.... he made it clear that rape is an abhorrent act,"" a spokesman said.
""BBC management has told Nick that some of his comments were very ill-judged and he has apologised for any offence that may have been caused.""
Katie Russell, from Rape Crisis, said the ""ignorant comments"" showed there were ""still a number of pervasive and harmful myths around sexual violence"".
""The idea that men's sexual desires render them incapable of taking responsibility for their actions, or of respecting another person's right to choose what happens to their body, is unfounded, outdated and offensive to men,"" she said.
""The idea that women should take responsibility for men's sexuality is equally insulting to both men and women.""
Jessica Asato, Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate for Norwich North, called for Mr Conrad to apologise on air.
Posting on her Twitter account, she called his comments ""demeaning and crass towards women"".

Edinburgh flanker Hugh Blake has been called into the squad for the first time, in preference to both Brown and Barclay.
Blake qualifies to play for the national team through his Scottish grandparents.
Brown, 32, led Scotland into last year's Six Nations as captain, only to be dropped from the squad for the home defeat to England then recalled as captain for the loss to France at Murrayfield.

Barclay has excelled in the back-row for Welsh side Scarlets this season and, at 28, is likely to have several seasons left at the top level.
Former Bath and Glasgow scrum-half Nicol says favouring players who play their rugby in Scotland isn't necessarily wrong, but that ultimately the decision should come down to ability.
""There's not been a stated policy about not picking players playing in Scotland,"" Nicol continued.
""There are a number of players (in the squad) who play outwith Scotland, but I think it's very clear that your chances of playing for Scotland are greatly heightened by playing for Edinburgh and Glasgow.
""That might be the right thing to do, don't get me wrong.
""I just think that, if you're picking your best players for this Six Nations, and forget the World Cup, because if they're good enough for the Six Nations then you're good enough for the World Cup, you pick your best players and I would've thought Kelly Brown and John Barclay in particular are two that would come in there.""
Despite reservations about the omission of some experienced players, Nicol is positive about Scotland's chances in the Six Nations.
""I'm quite excited about what could happen,"" he said. ""It was a good Autumn series.
""A very good performance against Argentina, good again against the best team in the world, New Zealand, and then finished it off well against Tonga.
""So there's a lot of confidence in the squad.
""Edinburgh have improved markedly since the Autumn tests and that's reflected in more players coming in from Edinburgh.

34941179,"Lambert will be the headline act of a lavish New Year's Eve show organised and televised live nationally by state-owned broadcaster MediaCorp.
Over the course of the week, thousands of Singaporeans have flocked online to sign two duelling petitions.
One, started on Wednesday, calls on MediaCorp and the government to drop Lambert, on account of his support for gay rights and reputation for risque performances, which it called ""contrary to mainstream Singaporean values"".
Comments on the petition called Lambert's performances ""disgusting"", ""disturbing"" and ""lewd"". ""Please give more wholesome role models to our youths,"" said one petitioner Elaine Lui.
A counter petition was started on Thursday night and quickly gathered steam, calling on organisers to keep Lambert as a demonstration that Singapore ""shuns discrimination and promotes diverse inclusive points of view"".
""In no way whatsoever does his sexual orientation have any relation to his role as an entertainer and singer. Asking for him to be banned on TV is ludicrous and is akin to asking retailers to stop selling iPhones because [Apple has a] gay CEO,"" said commenter Ivan Lin.
As of Friday evening, both petitions were neck-to-neck with thousands of signatures each, drawing in supporters from Malaysia, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan as well.
Lambert previously performed in Singapore in 2013 to few complaints, and concerts by other artists such as Lady Gaga have generated greater controversy.
The debate over Lambert this time stems from a cultural divide in Singapore that has widened recently.
A modern and open city-state with a thriving gay scene and liberal minority, much of its society also remains deeply conservative. A religious right, supported by some Christians and Muslims, has grown in tandem with a burgeoning gay rights movement.
The annual gay rights event Pink Dot, where supporters don pink as a message of inclusion, has sparked a counter campaign called Wear White where conservatives tog themselves in white as a symbol of purity.
Both sides have become more vocal in recent years, and though the conflict has not gone beyond heated debate, it has unnerved Singapore officials charged with maintaining the peace on the tiny island.
They have tried to strike a balance. A controversial law that bans gay sex - a key flashpoint in the divide - remains on the books, but the government has promised never to enforce it.
Authorities have also sought to rein in both camps by curbing their public demonstrations, in some cases refusing permits to both conservative and gay rights groups to hold or expand their public events.
As for Lambert, they appear to have come to a compromise.
MediaCorp has not dropped him - but has promised that the show will conform to strict broadcast regulations and be made ""suitable for family audiences"".
Meanwhile, Lambert has said in a statement that his performance would ""celebrate the entire human family in all its diversity"" and that he was ""a uniter, not a divider"".",A growing controversy over a Singapore concert starring openly gay US singer Adam Lambert has highlighted a widening cultural divide in the strait-laced city-state.

Three photographs were found behind skirting boards of one of the former shops.
One shows a young boy holding what may be a catapult, standing next to a young girl in a hat. Two other Victorian studio portraits are of smartly-dressed gentlemen.
Calderdale Council said one was a tintype photograph, widely used in the 1860s and 70s.
An un-lidded wooden box was found labelled with Emsley & Collins Ltd, possibly a local company, and a pile of oyster shells was found in the cellar.

Bahamas police investigated because the ship is registered in the island state, leaving it outside UK jurisdiction.

Former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott said that should be the case whatever the ship's ""flag of convenience"" - where it is registered.
Ms Coriam's MP Chris Matheson said he feared she was murdered and has called for a UK inquiry.
The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) said disappearances overboard were ""incredibly rare"".
Ms Coriam was last seen alive on 21 March 2011 on board the ship where she worked as a child minder.
Her credit card, which was not found among her personal effects, was used after she vanished.
Mr Matheson said: ""I believe there's sufficient evidence to indicate a crime may well have taken place.
""Whatever the circumstance, there's an obligation to investigate. My worst fear is Rebecca Coriam was murdered.""
He said it was a ""real possibility"" she had been killed and the case had not been properly investigated.

""We're the victims here as well,"" he said.
Cheshire Police insist the report is not its property to share.
But Mr Coriam said: ""It's our daughter. There's been an investigation. Why hold it from us? ""
In addition to the frustration over the report, the family has been unable to hold an inquest or a funeral as Ms Coriam's remains have not been recovered.
Under the Flags of Convenience system, ships are registered in offshore nations, often for tax purposes, and if crimes are committed on board it is up to the flag nation to investigate.
National jurisdiction only extends up to 24 miles beyond a coastline - beyond that, the law of the country whose flag the ship flies applies.
The Bahamas sent over police Supt Paul Rolle to investigate Rebecca's case.
Lord Prescott called for an end to the flags arrangement and for a US-style system in which the FBI investigates maritime crimes involving US citizens, no matter where a ship is registered.
Lord Prescott, a former ship steward, echoed calls for an inquiry, saying: ""People don't know whether she died or she was thrown over the side.
""What is so alarming is many people are going missing and nothing is being done about it, except for America.""
He said there was ""almost like a conspiracy of silence"" surrounding the case, adding there should be a change in the law as we ""should be looking after our citizens"".

It is understood Mr Marcin, 42, worked at York Cars Taxi Service, a cab company in York.
Mr Marcin and his wife, aged 39, had taken a picture of themselves together in Manchester shortly before going to the concert to collect their daughters.
This was shared on social media by their daughter on Tuesday.
She wrote: ""Anyone who is in any safe place or hospital in Manchester, if anyone comes across my parents please please let me know as they've been missing ever since the attack, this is a picture taken tonight so this is exactly what they were wearing.""
In a statement, the Polish foreign ministry said: ""We share the pain of the family and the loved ones of the victims and express our most sincere condolences.
""Consuls have offered assistance to the family of the victims.""
The Polish Foreign Minister, Witold Waszczykowski, told a radio station: ""The parents came after the concert to collect their daughters and unfortunately we have information that they are dead. The children are safe.""
Dr Alison Birkinshaw, principal at York College, described the deaths as ""devastating news for Alex and her family, the whole college and the wider community"".
She said: ""We are in touch with Alex and will do whatever we can to support her and her family.""

15241052,"Home Secretary Theresa May said Mr Bristow would lead an agency of ""powerful operational crime fighters"".
The NCA becomes fully operational in 2013 when it takes over from the Serious Organised Crime Agency.
Its expanded role will include powers to order police forces to run operations into drugs and trafficking.
As well as replacing the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), the new agency will take in the work of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), and also house the national cyber crime unit. It will also cover border policing and economic crime.
""For too long we have lacked a strong, collaborative national response in the fight for criminal justice. The NCA will make the UK a more hostile environment for serious and organised crime and strengthen our border,"" Mrs May said.
She said Mr Bristow would play ""a vital role"" in developing the agency.
Details of an extensive policing shake-up, which included the creation of the National Crime Agency, were unveiled last year by Mrs May in a Home Office consultation paper - Policing in the 21st Century.
She described it as the ""most radical reform of policing for 50 years"".
Mr Bristow said he would work with the government and other crime agencies ""to ensure that the NCA delivers the maximum protection possible for communities within the resources it has available"".
""In partnership with other law enforcement agencies, we will ensure that criminals are identified, pursued and brought to justice, their groups dismantled and their activities disrupted. We will do even more to strip away their illegally obtained assets,"" he said.
Association of Chief Police Officers president Sir Hugh Orde said Mr Bristow had been chosen from ""a very strong field of police leaders"" to lead the NCA.
""A better co-ordinated response between the international reach and capability of this new agency and the 'eyes and ears' of local neighbourhood policing teams can help keep our streets and communities safer,"" Sir Hugh said.
Mr Bristow was appointed chief constable of Warwickshire Police in 2006 and chairs the G8 Law Enforcement Group.
He has been the Association of Chief Police Officers' head of crime and worked in the West Midlands Police and as director of the National Criminal Intelligence Service.","The first head of the UK's incoming National Crime Agency (NCA) will be Keith Bristow, currently chief constable of Warwickshire."

36288677,"On the second anniversary of Stephen's death, the charity has also outlined how the cash has aided cancer services for young people.
Stephen died on 14 May 2014, after contracting bowel cancer.
The 19-year-old, of Burntwood, Staffordshire, became well known after posting a picture online of his ""final thumbs up"" from a hospital bed.
He had pledged to raise £1m himself for the charity and hit the target three weeks before his death.
The trust said £2.7m had been spent refurbishing cancer units at hospitals across the country, with four more - in Cambridge, Hull, Newcastle and the Wirral - now to benefit.
A total of £1.6m has been used to train specialist nurses, as well as fund the charity's International Conference and Adolescent and Young Adult Global Cancer Congress in December.
Stephen's legacy is also helping fund JTV Cancer Support, a project helping young sufferers express their feelings and record their personal journeys.
Around £500,000 has been spent on education and awareness programmes, and £200,000 on conference weekends for youngsters called Find Your Sense of Tumour.
Stephen's mother Jane has now been made an official ambassador for the trust.
""Not a day goes by when I don't miss my brave and brilliant son. But when I think about everything he achieved and how much he's helping other young people, it makes me feel so proud,"" she said.
""With his voice in my ear, I've run a marathon, jumped out of a plane and in a few months, I'll be climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.
""I'm honoured to call myself an ambassador for Teenage Cancer Trust, and feel privileged to be able to continue to spread Stephen's unique message of positivity.""

37178643,"A member of the public found the two bodies as the tide receded at about 20:00 BST on Wednesday, the RNLI said.
A search is under way for a third person missing at the East Sussex beach. Lifeboats and a helicopter are combing the water off the coast.
Seven other people have died around the British coastline since Friday.
Richard Tollett, lifeboat operations manager at Rye Harbour, told the Press Association the RNLI received a request to launch at around 20:30.
He said: ""As the tide has receded it has left a couple more bodies on the beach in the sand.
""A member of the public found them and that person reported another one in the water so we have got two lifeboats and a helicopter searching the area trying to find the other one.""
The first alert came just after 14:10 when coastguard helicopters, a lifeboat, rescue teams and an air ambulance were sent to the scene after reports three men were in need of urgent medical assistance.
The beach was cleared and the public were asked to stay away while the emergency services dealt with the incident.
Suggestions that their deaths may be linked to jellyfish have been ruled out.
Sussex Police stated there was nothing to suggest the men were migrants.
Ch Supt Di Roskilly said: ""This has been an incredibly tragic situation. At this stage we are doing all we can to establish who the men are and to identify next of kin.""
Eyewitness Natalja Taylor, 30, said she saw three people being pulled out of the water, apparently by ""regular people, not emergency personnel"".
""There were so many people there. They were still on the beach when we left,"" she said.
She said police drove on to the beach with a loudspeaker telling people not to go into the water until further notice, and also taped off ""a huge chunk of the beach so no-one could get near it"".
She said: ""It's pretty scary. I'm not sure how it happened. We decided not to go into the sea after seeing warning signs about some kind of fish.
""It wasn't particularly windy down there, it was just a hot, sunny beach day.""
Charlotte Frederick, from London, who saw the rescue operation take place, said: ""One was taken away on a rescue truck and the other two were left behind.""
She said she realised later that the other two men had also died.
""We saw them take up a blanket and then after that we saw them taken in a body bag. It was really distressing,"" she said.
The incident happened on the hottest day of the year when the beach was packed with people.
Ch Supt Roskilly said: ""This has been an incredibly tragic situation and very traumatic for those who were there on the beach at the time.""
Last month, 19-year-old Brazilian Gustavo Silva Da Cruz died after getting into difficulty while swimming in the sea there. He was one of three men who got into trouble in the water.
Camber Sands is a popular destination for beach-goers and Rother District Council provides beach patrols there throughout the summer.
A council spokesman said: ""While it's very upsetting to see two similar, tragic incidents this summer, over the years these kind of incidents are extremely rare and on a fine day around 25,000 people use the beach safely.""
He said the beach patrols were able to advise people of potential dangers, reunite lost children with their families and deal with incidents on the beach.
""Although it's too early to draw any conclusions from this latest incident, in recent years we have seen a change in the make-up of visitors to Camber, including more people from outside the area who are not familiar with the sea and the dangers it can pose,"" he said.
He said incidents had included visitors entering the sea even though they could not swim, and in some cases going into the water fully clothed.","Two more bodies have been found on the beach at Camber Sands, hours after three men were pulled from the water on the hottest day of the year."

39710723,"A total of 28% had not talked about the symptoms, the University of Aberdeen paper revealed.
Lead author Dr Peter Murchie said it highlighted the complications surrounding emergency cancer diagnosis.
Cancer Research UK said it was a complex area.
The study - published in the British Journal of Cancer - said that, of those who had previously flagged symptoms to their doctor, 81% had been appropriately referred on by their GP for further treatment or investigation of their symptoms.
However it said 19% could be viewed as missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis.
The study, funded by the Scottish Chief Scientist's Office, involved a review of the case notes from 1,800 patients diagnosed with cancer in northern Scotland and registered at GP surgeries across NHS Grampian, Orkney and Shetland.
Dr Murchie, a GP and researcher at the University of Aberdeen, said: ""This study sheds light on the complications surrounding emergency cancer diagnosis and how quickly circumstances can change for the patient.
""It's vital we do more to ensure people with persistent or unusual symptoms feel confident about getting them checked out by a doctor without delay.
""And it's equally important to give GPs better access to the tests and specialist advice they need to help them spot potential cancer symptoms at the earliest stage.""
Jodie Moffat, Cancer Research UK's head of early diagnosis, said: ""For some patients, emergency presentation may be difficult to avoid, but for others there are often things that could have been done differently.
""Studies like this help us to understand this complex picture and identify what needs to change.
""Cancer patients diagnosed as an emergency are more likely to have late stage disease and poorer survival. So it's vital we do all we can to break down barriers to people visiting their doctor with symptoms that could be cancer.
""Cancer Research UK is also working with GPs in Scotland to help improve early cancer diagnosis and ensure they have the freedom to refer patients for further tests and access specialist advice if cancer is suspected.""","More than a quarter of cancer patients diagnosed as an emergency in the north of Scotland had not discussed any relevant symptoms with their GP beforehand, according to a new study."
16583218,"Speaking in South Carolina, Mr Huntsman endorsed the candidacy of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.
Mr Huntsman received just 17% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary despite campaigning extensively there.
He has struggled to build momentum in South Carolina, where the conservative vote is traditionally strong.
The Palmetto State goes to the polls on Saturday to pick a candidate for the Republican nomination.
The Huntsman campaign had difficulty gaining traction nationally, attracting about 1% to 2% in most opinion polls.
As he announced his withdrawal from the race, Mr Huntsman, who pitched himself at his campaign launch as a ""civil"" candidate who would not play dirty, bemoaned the state of the Republican contest.
By Mark MardellBBC North America editor
Read Mark's thoughts in full
Profile: Jon Huntsman
""This race has degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks,"" he said, calling on the Republican party to unite behind a single candidate.
""Divisiveness is corrosive,"" he added, saying that the ""the current toxic form of our political discourse does not help our cause"".
Mr Huntsman, 51, is a fluent Mandarin speaker and served as US President Barack Obama's first ambassador to China.
In the early 1990s he became the youngest head of a US diplomatic mission for a century when he was appointed ambassador in Singapore.
Mr Huntsman's withdrawal from the race came the morning after he received an endorsement from The State, the largest newspaper in South Carolina.
They called Mr Huntsman and Mr Romney the ""two sensible, experienced grown-ups in the race'', but said the former ambassador was ""more principled"" and offered ""a significantly more important message''.
Mr Huntsman threw his support behind Mr Romney, calling him the candidate most likely to defeat President Obama in November's presidential elections.
Acknowledging differences between him and Mr Romney - whom Mr Huntsman sharply criticised in recent weeks - he said he would nevertheless support the former Massachusetts governor.
Grover Norquist, a prominent advocate for tax reform, writes in Politico's The Arena that ""there was a possible Huntsman strategy. He just needed to get started earlier... He could have been Wisconsin's Scott Walker before Walker. He could have been Chris Christie.""
But The Washington Post's The Fix wonders whether there was ever a way for the Huntsman campaign to have influenced the race: ""He needed a vulnerable Romney. And Iowa was the entire field's best chance to show that Romney's front-runner status was shaky at best. Huntsman couldn't have beaten Romney in Iowa, but he could have kept the former Massachusetts governor from winning.""
Meanwhile, The Caucus blog at the New York Times questions how much of an impact Huntsman's backing will make to the Romney campaign: ""The endorsement may not significantly change the shape of the race, but it could inject a new dynamic into a debate Monday night on the Fox News Channel.""
Paul West writes in the LA Times that the Huntsman campaign probably failed to meet its own targets: ""It's unlikely that Huntsman met his own goals as a presidential candidate, and an argument can be made that he did virtually nothing to advance his future prospects. That would be particularly true if Romney is elected and declines to offer him a decent job.""
Differences within the Republican party were less important, Mr Huntsman said, than what he termed a grave crisis facing the US.
In the wake of Mr Huntsman's endorsement, Mr Romney said: ""I salute Jon Huntsman and his wife Mary Kaye. Jon ran a spirited campaign based on unity not division, and love of country. I appreciate his friendship and support.""
But Mr Santorum dismissed the endorsement, saying it came as no surprise. ""Moderates are backing moderates,"" he said. ""I anticipated that actually sooner than today.""
Mr Romney won nearly 40% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary and won the Iowa caucuses with a narrow lead of eight votes.
Mr Huntsman's exit from the race leaves five candidates remaining: Rick Santorum, Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich as the three main candidates chasing Mr Romney's lead, and Rick Perry trailing in the polls.
The candidates were meeting voters in South Carolina's Myrtle Beach, with Mr Paul returning to the campaign trail after a four-day break, ahead of a national debate to be hosted by Fox News.
Polls show that South Carolina's conservative vote has not yet settled on one particular candidate.
""I think the only way that a Massachusetts moderate can get through South Carolina is if the vote is split,"" Mr Gingrich said on Sunday.
A group of five faith leaders endorsed Mr Gingrich while emphasising that support was still split across the influential voting bloc.
Mr Santorum also worked through the weekend to encourage evangelical Christian voters to choose his candidacy, telling reporters on Monday: ""I think it's important that we eventually consolidate this race.""
However, correspondents say momentum in the Romney campaign is building and an Insider Advantage opinion poll released on Monday shows the former businessman maintaining a significant lead over the rest of the field.
Mr Gingrich, Mr Santorum and Mr Perry have all suggested that Mr Romney's campaign is benefiting from the fractured social conservative support base.","Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman has ended his presidential campaign, saying that ""negative and personal attacks"" have marred the Republican race."

He suggested the sport's governing body the FIA would look at the incident, and added: ""I would be surprised if that went unreprimanded.""

Both Horner and former Red Bull team-mate Daniel Ricciardo suggested Vettel's lack of success at Ferrari could have played a part in his outburst.
""It is not an attribute he had when he drove for us. Obviously his frustration he is vocalising, and everybody can hear that,"" Horner said.
""I definitely sense he has been a bit more frustrated this year,"" Ricciardo added.

Spain looked set for victory after 38-year-old Buffon's error as he completely missed the ball when trying to clear a through ball to Vitolo.
However, substitute Ciro Immobile brought some much-needed energy and threat to the home attack and a rash Ramos challenge allowed De Rossi to score.

""The scale, co-ordination and leadership of a doping system like this is arguably the most heinous crime possible against the Olympic movement,"" said the former skeleton racer.
""So, somewhat reluctantly, I am led to one conclusion: exclusion from Rio.""
Many Great Britain Olympic and Paralympic stars have endorsed a letter sent by The Times to the IOC urging the organisation to ban Russia from Rio.
The signatories include swimmer Rebecca Adlington, 400m hurdler Sally Gunnell, long jumper Lynn Davies and 11-time Paralympic gold medallist Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson.
The letter, which was organised by the newspaper, has been sent to the IOC's executive board, which will make the decision on whether to have a blanket ban on Russia's participation.
The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has already excluded Russia's track and field team from the Games.
Pengilly, a member of the IOC's Athletes' Commission and one of four British IOC members, conceded: ""I say reluctantly [that Russia should be banned] because there are very probably clean Russian athletes, and they will suffer, and this is nothing short of terrible.
""It's an incredibly tough decision. There's no fair outcome for everyone.""
But he insisted: ""The Russian flag should not be flown at the Rio Olympic Games.""
In 2013 Pengilly received praise for raising the issue of doping before the vote to decide a host of the 2020 Games, questioning both Spain and Turkey during their bid presentations in Buenos Aires.
Russia could face a blanket ban after a damning report compiled by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren claimed it operated a state-sponsored doping programme from 2011 to 2015.
The IOC is exploring ""legal options"" before deciding whether to implement ""a collective ban"" on all Russian competitors for the global showpiece, which starts on 5 August.
A decision by its executive board could come on Sunday.
""Clean athletes, the Olympic Games and the wider Olympic movement have been mocked,"" Pengilly said.
""However, Russia is an important sporting nation - we want and need them fully involved in the future, but only when they can do it cleanly.
""Therefore, I firmly believe that we should offer support and assistance to the Russian Federation so they can escape from this ugly culture and cycle.""
Russia will find out in August if it is to be banned from the 2016 Paralympics in Rio.
The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has ""opened suspension proceedings"" following the publication of the McLaren report earlier this week.
Paralympian David Weir has accused the IPC of being ""naive"" in their handling of doping allegations.
The wheelchair athlete, who won four golds at London 2012, told BBC Sport: ""It looks like they are being naive and maybe thought that Paralympians don't cheat, but they are all public funded and there are sponsors so if you want that margin gain maybe you will cheat.
""The IPC should have put their foot down straight away.""
Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev said he was ""saddened"" by the ""unacceptable"" prospect of a total ban on Russian competitors.
Gorbachev, the last General Secretary of the Soviet Union before its dissolution in 1991, has written an open letter to the IOC.
In it, he said: ""I support the fight against prohibited substances in sport. It is evil that must be eradicated. Those athletes who are proven to have doped should be banned from competitions.
""At the same time, I am concerned and deeply saddened by the possibility that in case all Russian athletes are banned from competing in the Olympic Games, the innocent will be punished together with the guilty.""","Russia should be banned from Rio 2016, says British International Olympic Committee member Adam Pengilly."

Earlier this month, search teams said signals from one of the ""black box"" flight recorders had been detected.
Signals emitted by the recorders are expected to expire by 24 June, experts have warned.
The cause of the crash remains a mystery.
A terror attack has not been ruled out but no extremist group has claimed the downing of the plane.
Analysts say human or technical error is also a possibility. Flight data revealed that smoke detectors went off in the toilet and the aircraft's electrics, minutes before the plane's signal was lost.
According to Greek investigators, the plane turned 90 degrees left and then 360 degrees to the right, dropping from 11,300m (37,000ft) to 4,600m (15,000ft) and then 3,000m (10,000ft) before it was lost from radar.","Wreckage of the EgyptAir flight that went missing over the Mediterranean last month has been found, Egyptian investigators say."

An election is due to be held next year after four years of coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD).
Mrs Merkel's poll ratings have slipped since the height of her popularity but she retains wide support.
The chancellor, who has been in office since 2005, is also being challenged by the populist right-wing AfD party.
She announced she would stand again after meeting party leaders at CDU headquarters.
She told reporters that the decision to run for a fourth term had been ""anything but trivial after 11 years in office"".
She added that she expected challenges from both the right and the left of the political spectrum.
Is Merkel really on the ropes?
Profile: Angela Merkel
In September, Mrs Merkel accepted responsibility for election defeats for the CDU in several states and conceded that her open-door policy towards migrants was a factor.
Germany expected up to 300,000 migrants to arrive in the country this year, the head of the country's federal office for migration and refugees said earlier this year.
In 2015, Germany received more than a million applications for asylum.
She's kept Germany guessing for weeks, but it looks as though Angela Merkel has finally answered the so called K-frage (chancellor question).
A poll for one Sunday newspaper (in German) found that 55% of Germans would vote for her. Mrs Merkel's approval ratings have gone up and down in recent months as a result of her refugee policy but they remain the envy of other world leaders.
Even so, she will be battling the tide of populism that swept Donald Trump to victory in the States and which is also washing across Europe. The anti-Muslim party Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD) is likely to win seats in the national parliament next year. It's highly unlikely to take Mrs Merkel down but it is leaching votes from Germany's established political parties.
Those parties are - by and large - likely to be relieved by Mrs Merkel's decision. In the past few years the job of German chancellor has become one of the most powerful political positions in the world. The next incumbent must not only lead the country but deal with a fragmenting EU, in a world which may be much changed by the new US administration.
It's widely (sometimes grudgingly ) accepted here that there simply isn't another realistic candidate for the job. As one broadcaster put it: ""Angela Merkel - the indispensable"".

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said PC Helen Hardie ""had a case to answer for gross misconduct"".
The force said it ""disagreed with the content of their [IPCC] report"".
More on this and other North Yorkshire stories
In its report, the IPCC said an ambulance had gone to the park after a member of the public had contacted them to say he had pulled a man out out of the lake.
A paramedic searched the park for about 38 minutes but could not find the missing man, so he called the police.
PC Hardie attended the scene at about 04:00 GMT.
The IPCC report said: ""A four-minute search was carried out before PC Hardie left the area, she did not seek assistance and the incident log was closed soon after.""
It added that the officer concluded the missing man had fled the scene ""despite a paramedic's view that he would be incapable of such action because of freezing temperatures"".
She later told an inspector ""there was no evidence a man had been pulled from the lake"".
Mr Egan's body was found at about 11:30 GMT.
The IPCC investigator said that in his opinion ""PC Hardie had a case to answer for gross misconduct"".
In a statement, North Yorkshire Police said: ""We disagreed with the content of their report and their finding that it amounted to gross misconduct.
""We appealed their report and it was subsequently agreed with the IPCC that a misconduct meeting would be held.
""This has been carried out and the officer has been issued with a written warning.""","A North Yorkshire Police officer made ""errors"" in the search for a missing man who was later found dead in the lake of a public park, the police watchdog has found."
35025408,"The decision came after an inquiry found that the tragedy could have been avoided if Harry Clarke had not lied about his history of blackouts.
Mr Clarke, 58, was unconscious when the lorry veered out of control on 22 December 2014, killing six people.
The inquiry found he had ""repeatedly lied in order to gain and retain jobs"".
Relatives of Erin McQuade and Jack and Lorraine Sweeney made the announcement about the private prosecution after a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into the crash published its findings.
In their statement, they criticised a decision by the Crown Office not to prosecute Mr Clarke and said they had instructed their own lawyers to take action.
The family said: ""The family note the press release by the Crown and they contend they were right not to prosecute the driver.
""We firmly remain of the view that they are wrong as is their interpretation of the findings and recommendations.
""As a result we have instructed our solicitor to commence a prosecution against the driver.""
The family's statement came after the Crown Office said: ""There are no findings in the determination that undermine the decisions not to prosecute the driver.
""There was no finding that the driver knew or ought to have known that he was unfit to drive.""
The statement concluded: ""We note the sheriff's findings on the driver's motivation to retain or gain employment.
""It is important to note the sheriff was considering evidence at an FAI where a lesser standard of proof is required and where more relaxed rules of evidence apply.
""A criminal prosecution requires sufficient evidence to the much higher standard beyond reasonable doubt.""
The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) at Glasgow Sheriff Court, before Sheriff John Beckett, was set up after the Crown Office decided not to prosecute anyone over the crash.
The inquiry, which concluded in August, examined the circumstances of the tragedy.
Sheriff Beckett's determination is critical in particular of driver Harry Clarke, stating outright that the crash might have been avoided had he not lied about his medical history.
But there are also implications for Glasgow City Council and potentially all local authorities; for doctors and GPs; and for the DVLA and driver licensing right across the UK. It includes appeals to government ministers and could see changes to the law.
As well as eight ""reasonable precautions"" which could have prevented the crash - all relating to Mr Clarke's health - the sheriff outlined 19 recommendations which could reduce the chances of such an incident recurring in future.
Read more from BBC Scotland reporter Philip Sim, who covered the inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court
In his report, Sheriff Becket concluded: ""The most effective measure to prevent such an occurrence would be to seek to avoid drivers becoming incapacitated at the wheel.
""Responsibility in that regard lies with drivers themselves and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
""It may well be that the single most useful outcome of this inquiry would be to raise awareness of the dangers involved in driving if subject to a medical condition which could cause the driver to lose control of a vehicle.""
During evidence at the inquiry, it emerged that Mr Clarke had suffered an episode of neurocardiogenic syncope.
He passed out at the wheel while the bin lorry was on Queen Street in Glasgow city centre, just days before Christmas.
Just 19 seconds later, the vehicle came to rest against the Millennium Hotel in George Square, leaving six people dead and 17 injured.
Those killed in the crash were Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, from Dumbarton, Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh.
After hearing five weeks of evidence earlier this year, Sheriff Beckett issued a determination which identifies eight reasonable precautions which could have prevented the tragedy.
All relate to an earlier blackout Mr Clarke experienced at the wheel of a bus on 7 April 2010 and his subsequent failure to fully disclose his medical history.
Sheriff Beckett said Mr Clarke could have ""told the whole truth"" to his doctors about this incident, ""refrained from continuing to drive buses"" and provided ""true and accurate information about his medical history"" in later health questionnaires and assessments.
Other precautions relate to doctors advising Mr Clarke to notify the DVLA and clarifying the circumstances of his blackout ""before concluding that he had suffered a simple faint"".
A final precaution would have been for his then employer, bus firm First Glasgow, to have ""provided a full, accurate and fair employment reference to Glasgow City Council"".
The inquiry heard that the council was not made aware that Mr Clarke faced disciplinary procedures at First Bus, related to repeated sick leave, when he left First Bus.
Sheriff Beckett also made 19 recommendations which covered possible legislative changes, disclosure of medical information, the DVLA, Glasgow City Council and local authorities in general.
One of the most significant is for the UK transport secretary to look at whether doctors should be given greater freedom, or an obligation, to report fitness to drive concerns directly to the DVLA.
There is also a call for the transport secretary to consult on how best to ensure that the DVLA has the proper information to make fitness to drive licensing decisions.
Sheriff Beckett said part of this should consider increasing the penalties and altering the method of prosecution for non-disclosure.
His report also calls on the DVLA to provide greater clarity and guidance on how people who suffer losses of consciousness should be treated in respect of fitness to drive.
He also recommends the DVLA should ""change its policy"" so relevant information on fitness to drive, from third parties such as the police, could be investigated.
Sheriff Beckett also said the agency should ""redouble its efforts to raise awareness of the implications of medical conditions for fitness to drive"".
A DVLA spokesman said: ""We are carefully considering the recommendations in the report.""
The General Medical Council said vital ""lessons were learned"" from the crash.
Chief executive Niall Dickson said: ""We will be studying the report in detail and any implications for the GMC and its responsibilities.
'The responsibility for informing the DVLA about medical conditions sits first and foremost with the patient.
""But doctors have responsibilities too and we are clear that they do have a vital role in helping to keep the public safe.""",A family which lost three members in the Glasgow bin lorry crash is to go ahead with a bid to stage a private prosecution of the driver.
29870980,"I called it a circus act, a freak show. I said it had all the weird fascination of one of those Victorian Odditoriums with Wang the Human Unicorn and Ella the infamous Camel Girl. The appeal of an Old Firm derby is not so much the football but the grisliness surrounding the football.
That's the marketability of this game - the rot. It's not known as one of the most storied derbies in world football because of the quality of the action on the field. Maybe it was back in the day - undoubtedly it was - but that hasn't been the case for a long time now.
Those who get drawn to it do so because of its essential madness, its toxicity, its poison. That's an uncomfortable admission given the nature of some of the things that go on around this match - the bigotry, the violence, the viciousness and hysteria on social media. But it's the truth.
At its craziest, it's football's equivalent of the Jim Rose Circus. And, love it or loathe it, for the next three months, there will be little escape from it.
It's back - or soon will be. It was inevitable. Plenty have missed it. Plenty of others have not.  It is possible to celebrate its return while also having an acute dread. That might seem like a contradiction, but in the strange world of the Old Firm, it makes some kind of sense.
By the time it comes around, it will have been almost three years since the previous meeting of these two clubs. Expect that to be reflected in the acreage of newsprint and radio hours that will be expended on this Scottish League Cup semi-final.
Before a previous meeting, I spent the week counting the number of newspaper pages given over to the fixture, from the Monday before to the Monday after. I gave up halfway through when the count had soared to over 100. One title had 27 pages dedicated to the game on one day alone. After a gap of three years, the mind boggles as to what lays ahead in terms of countdown.
If you stop your stopwatch at the point when it was obvious that they would be drawn together, it probably it took a fraction of a millisecond for the first tweets to land, like blows to the jaw of their rivals.

Some among the Celtic support are steadfast in their belief that a unique occurrence is going to take place next year - the first meeting of the sides.
Something akin to virtual spontaneous combustion happened on social media. As commentators ran through the gamut of Things We Cannot Say (TWCS), there was a predictable and plentiful response.  ""Previous meetings"" - there's been none. ""Rivalry"" - doesn't exist. ""Rangers"" - no such club.
This coterie of Celtic fans say they see this League Cup semi-final as a match with no history. We must assume, by extension, that they believe the Celtic crowd at Hampden for the semi-final will be no more passionate and no more desperate for success than, say, a crowd at a Celtic v Dundee United semi; that victory, if it comes, will taste no sweeter than if it was Aberdeen they were playing.
Just another semi-final? Really? Truly?
Listening to the reaction from Celtic Park would have done nothing for those who hang on to the belief that next year's meeting will be the first of its kind. Respectfully, the very people at the heart of their own club do not agree.
In the immediate aftermath of the draw, Ronny Deila, the Celtic manager, spoke about the renewal of the Old Firm derby. Stefan Johansen's comments were those of a man who believes that this is a continuation rather than a beginning.
They're not alone. From the boardroom to the dressing-room, Celtic people have spoken in the recent past (sometimes off the record for fear of incurring the anger of some of the support) about Rangers not as a new entity but as a club they were looking forward to playing against again  - if only for the financial benefits that will come with having their ground full and their media partners salivating anew at a minimum of four Celtic v Rangers matches every season.
In the real world, the Old Firm rivalry lives on and we'll see it in all its dubious glory on 31 January or 1 February. It will look the same, it will sound the same. Victory and defeat will engender the same response as it always has - joy and despair on an industrial scale.
Deila said something else when he was asked for his reaction upon hearing the draw. He said that that the game was three months away and as a result ""it's a little bit early to be talking about it.""
God bless him in his innocence. Rangers manager Ally McCoist knows only too well what's coming and it's a media whirlwind the like of which Deila has never seen before in his footballing life. If he thinks his time at Celtic has been intense then it's about to build to a dizzying high.
Deila needs to strap himself in. There's turbulence ahead.","A few years back, in the days before former owner Craig Whyte ever darkened Rangers' door and in a time when Charles Green was selling his bombast elsewhere, I wrote a column about the nature of the Old Firm derby as I saw it."

Following an appeal by British Transport Police (BTP), she came forward voluntarily, officers said.
At the time of the incident, rail bosses described it as ""one of the closest near misses we've seen"".
BTP released the CCTV of the Cambridge woman passing the closed barrier and ignoring warning signals and lights.
Hundreds of thousands of people watched the footage of her cycling up to the tracks before slamming on her brakes, and edging backwards as the train sped past.
Moments later the woman was seen mopping her brow before cycling off in the direction she had come from.
Her actions forced the driver of the train to apply the emergency brake when he saw her, operator Greater Anglia said.
More than 100 trains travel through the Waterbeach crossing each day, at speeds of up to 75mph (120km/h).
Since 1 January, there have been 70 reported incidents at level crossings in Cambridgeshire, a BTP spokesman said.
However, incidents such as this one were ""extremely rare"", he added.
The woman was cautioned under section 36 of the Malicious Damages Act 1861.
The section covers incidents of ""obstructing engines or carriages on railways"", which carries a maximum sentence of two years in jail.","A cyclist who dodged a closed level crossing barrier, coming within inches of being hit by a train, has been formally cautioned by police."

39446549,"They described a horrific scene at the end of the two day stand-off at Moulvibazar near Sylhet.
Police told local media the militants detonated a grenade after failing to escape and to avoid being captured.
The dead are believed to include members of a local jihadist group.
On Saturday six people - two police officers and four civilians - were killed in twin bombings in Sylhet when commandos flushed out another group of suspected Islamist militants.
So-called Islamic State (IS) claimed on messaging app Telegram that it was behind one of the blasts.
In the latest incident on Thursday, police told The Daily Star that the bodies were discovered when a bomb disposal team entered the militants' den after ""disposing of grenades and bombs [which were] lying scattered on the floor"" of the building.
The paper says that the sound of gunfire and explosions could be constantly heard right up until the time the security forces entered the premises.
It is unclear how a child was apparently caught up in the violence.
The BBC's Waliur Rahman in Dhaka says that another suspected hideout in the same north-eastern area has also been surrounded by police since Wednesday.
Meanwhile, law enforcers are also keeping a close watch on a building in the eastern town of Comilla, where a similar raid to flush out militants is imminently expected.
The escalation in violence comes at a time when many in Bangladesh thought security forces had managed to curb Islamist militancy, following the deadly siege on a cafe in Dhaka last year.
Recent suicide attacks on security camps and checkpoints have surprised many.
IS has claimed to be behind at least two other incidents this month, including one at a checkpoint near Bangladesh's international airport and one involving a man who tried to cross a checkpoint run by an elite police unit.
However, Bangladeshi police maintain that an offshoot of the banned Islamist outfit Jamiatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) is responsible for many of these attacks, despite claims to the contrary by IS and al-Qaeda.","Up to eight people including a child were killed when suspected Islamist militants blew themselves up after being surrounded in a hideout in north-eastern Bangladesh, police say."

37628866,"""I recovered from anorexia, I became bulimic and struggled with self-harm and depression and I was diagnosed with bipolar after that,"" says Ruby, who is now 22.
The illustrator and author, now known as Ruby etc, found herself in a cycle of hospitalisation from the age of 14, and she found each return to the classroom painfully stressful.
""I was too unwell for school a lot of the time and hated formal art classes in particular,"" she says, and night-school was a non-starter too.
Ruby is now building a successful career in art and has landed a publishing deal.
At 17 she left education and began to draw every day. At the time, it was one of the only things she could engage with and it became an important coping mechanism.
""When I drew it was a relief. It was catharsis,"" she says.
Her sketches started on post-it-sized bits of paper always with the aim of making herself laugh. The ""bizarre"" nature of the mental health system provided plenty of inspiration  - from the therapists to the mood stabilisers,  which she thought of as bike stabilisers that required her to ""do the peddlin'"".
""Often when I'm feeling really down I'll draw very silly things to take my mind off it all. Other times I might be feeling okay, but want to focus on something a little deeper or more serious,"" she says.
After encouragement from a friend, Elliot started to post her images online. Over the next three years she amassed 200,000 subscribers to her Tumblr blog, 31,000 fans on Facebook and 28,000 Instagram followers.
""I was so unwell and isolated but being able to put stuff on the internet and communicate with other people is something I could do from inside the house when I couldn't leave due to paranoia.""
Elliot now takes her sketchpad everywhere she goes and regards it as her ""safety blanket"". She doesn't do draft versions of her work, she just goes straight to it in pen - generally in black ink.
Being depressed for me feels like I've been steam-rollered by an external force that renders me a grotty non-human pancake of sadness. I become so saturated and overwhelmed with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness that the simplest of things become a giant effort - it can take me a week or more to convince myself to crawl into the shower. The subsequent shame and embarrassment about not being able to Do Anything is the icing on the cake really. I become noticeably slower. I sleep more. It's a scary place to be.
The other side - mania - or hypomania (mania but without psychotic symptoms) is like a switch flicks within me and I suddenly have masses of energy; I sleep less, I do more. I can seem quite happy and 'well'. But I will have a pretty constant stream of rushing thoughts I'm trying to manage, and although they can be exciting, when I get sleep deprived I get agitated. It can get to a point where I can't 'switch off' and that gets quite dangerous and destructive.
In the early days she had to deal with being ""hypercritical"" of herself and describes her sketchpad as one of the only places she didn't judge herself, saying: ""It's like a separate mental space.""
The healing power of art has now been formally recognised. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommends art therapy as a cost-effective way of helping people with depression.
Cal Strode from the Mental Health Foundation says it offers ""expression when the emotional issues we're experiencing are too confusing or distressing to communicate with words"".
He says focussing on an activity calms the mind, ""occupying and holding it in the present moment where it can't dwell on the past or worry about the future"".
His father, Liverpool artist Steve Strode, says he too has witnessed the power of art when he worked with another group which often finds itself isolated - inmates at a prison.
""Although people wouldn't openly talk about feelings or emotions to keep up a front, often these things would come through in their art,"" he says. ""People in my classes would sit and meditatively paint from photographs of family members for hours.
""It was their escape.""
For Elliot, that freedom has culminated in a book-deal which caused a five-way bidding war, for a collection of drawings and personal essays about her experiences.
""It was emotional digging things up and feeling them all over again, and battling with 'I'm not good enough' while trying to put this thing together and look after my health at the same time. But luckily I can sit at home and draw stuff at my desk if I don't want to go out. It has been stressful but very exciting.""
Elliot says she aimed to write and draw about mental health in the context of the person rather than ""the stuff"" which goes with it. ""I'm quite interested in bridging that polarising gap between illness and wellness - it's the question of degree and extent,"" she says.
Her book It's All Absolutely Fine is an irreverent look at mental health issues from anxiety to eating disorders and alienation.
Committing to the book project was a practice in managing her own condition and she was strict at giving herself time out. Sometimes she would work for a couple of hours, other days just 10 minutes, and she was also aware of how much social media influenced her productivity and motivation.
""I learned that I didn't have to post everything and I tend to steer clear of a lot of the negative stuff, but the positive response is a really great driving force,"" she says. ""I've never made it my prerogative to help people, but I'm touched and humbled when people say it's helped them.""
Elliot who works at ""an incredibly messy desk"" at her parents' house in London or in cafes ""without the distraction of computers"" said balancing her sanctuary against her new-found job was crucial when it has been so instrumental in her recovery.
""I still struggle with mood episodes so I try and retain as much of the enjoyment as I can with drawing - but it can be stressful knowing you've got to produce work,"" she says.
""The best work happens when I'm enjoying it; because if you're playing to the audience too much, or worrying about how popular it'll be, it always ends up being less funny, less 'you'.""
Ruby's story and pictures can be seen in her book It's All Absolutely Fine.","For Ruby Elliot her sketchbook was her only sanctuary from a life in ""constant crisis mode""."
37035966,"Now, after nearly two years in the post, his union is involved in four simultaneous fights with four different rail companies.
On Southern railway and ScotRail, his members have staged strikes against plans by the train companies to run more trains on which drivers, rather than guards, operate the doors.
The ScotRail dispute may be nearing resolution, while the latest Southern train strikes have now been called off for talks.
More recently, Virgin East Coast rail workers have voted for strike action, while RMT staff on Eurostar are set to stage two walkouts this month.
It seems that Mr Cash has a lot on his plate at the moment. But his tactics are still the same as those he outlined to the Guardian in September 2014, shortly after taking office.
""We negotiate first, we seek to get deals, but if we can't, we give our members the opportunity to have their say,"" he told the newspaper.
Mr Cash has been a member of the RMT, and its predecessor the National Union of Railwaymen, for 35 years.
He had some big shoes to fill when he became the union's general secretary. The previous occupant of the post, Bob Crow, widely portrayed as a left-wing bogeyman and a throwback to the more militant era of the 1970s, had become the best-known trade unionist in the UK.
In contrast, Mr Cash, who had been Mr Crow's deputy for 12 years, was immediately labelled a ""moderate"", despite his assertions that there would be ""no deviation from the industrial, political and organising strategy mapped out by RMT under Bob's leadership"".
Mr Cash is a long-time Labour supporter who has served on the party's National Executive Committee and as a local councillor. His association with Labour has continued even after the RMT was expelled from the party in 2004, while the union itself is now affiliated to the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.
He has never made any secret of his view that the railways should be renationalised. He has referred to rail companies as ""parasites"" and written that ""the only answer to this continuing rail chaos is public ownership"".
But rail industry observers say the RMT's main objective in the current round of disputes is not a political one, merely a desire to hold back a growing tendency to hand more tasks to train drivers and reduce the role of guards.
This, for the union, is an issue of safety. And given the way that passenger numbers have increased and trains have lengthened in recent years, some analysts feel the RMT does have a case.
Mr Cash is a railwayman through and through, having begun work with British Rail in 1978 in the signal and telegraph department. He joined the RMT full-time in 2002.
In the current wave of industrial action, he has been popping up on picket lines from Glasgow to Eastbourne, always ready to denounce rail bosses for ""ripping apart the safety culture on our railways"".
True, his public profile remains self-effacing, unlike that of his ebullient predecessor. But that may not matter too much, since he has held on to the big increase in membership that happened on Mr Crow's watch.
The RMT had just 57,000 members in 2002, but the total now stands at more than 82,000.
Without attracting the same attention, Mr Cash has quietly followed in Mr Crow's wake, following much the same policies.
""This union is in fighting shape for the battles that we know lie ahead,"" he said when he took office, and whatever the travelling public may think of the outcome, he has certainly faced those battles head on.","When Mick Cash took over as general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, he defined his approach as ""pick your fights""."
36425775,"Traditionally a place for studios to show off what they have been working on, this year the gaming industry extravaganza has shaped up a little differently.
Publisher EA has decided to run a separate event aimed at gamers, while rival Activision is letting the console companies promote its games, rather than having its own showcase.
""Usually it has been a retail show connecting publishers with buyers, but that is less relevant now due to the digital opportunities in gaming,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, director of games at consultancy IHS Technology.
""But E3 still has an important role to play. It's where people learn about new products coming to market.""
And plenty of studios have capitalised on the excitement around E3 to tease their new releases, many squeezing out announcements before doors open on 14 June.
Of course, if previous years are anything to go by, there are likely to be a few surprises during the week.
Harvey Smith has worked on critically acclaimed games including cyberpunk role-playing adventure Deus Ex, and stealth-action thriller Dishonored, which won the Bafta award for best game in 2013.
The BBC asked him to share the games he's most looking forward to at E3.
Overland
I'm a big fan of Adam Saltsman. His game Capsule - an incredibly tense and claustrophobic space travel game - is sublime. Overland is a thoughtful, soulful, post-apocalyptic road trip game with a beautifully laconic art style. Every year, there's an indie game or two that just feels like it was made for me. This year, it might be Overland.
Luna
I really like Robin Hunicke's work and the art style is super cute - but it goes beyond that. I love that you're not really sure what kind of game it will be. It's the combination of looking sweet and naive on the surface, but somehow hinting at something more complex and sophisticated. I suspect it's a bit of a Trojan horse in that respect.
No Man's Sky
We play games for a variety of reasons. Some people play games to demonstrate mastery over systems; some play to marvel at a reality beyond ours; some play to feel a sense of wonder at the ecological grandeur of the world. No Man's Sky promises all of that, seducing us with unknown possibilities.
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided
As one of the people to have participated in the genesis of the Deus Ex brand of dystopia, I am full of hope for the new Deus Ex game. If it's all I want it to be, it will present players with a gritty world gone wrong, challenging moral terrain, and flexible game systems that lead to improvisational ""play"" in the true sense of the word.
State of Decay 2 (Rumoured)
As a fan of often nihilistic zombie fiction, I was really drawn to State of Decay. The original was a gem in the rough. The best thing about the game was the way it kept enabling player-driven stories. So many times, I got into a tight spot of my own making, then managed to get out of it through creative play. Some moments left me sweating and yelling when I got back to home base, and those moments were generally unscripted. If the new game is more polished, this could be really strong.
Red Dead Redemption 2 (Rumoured)
I grew up watching spaghetti westerns. They're problematic, but they occupy a mythic place in my soul. I loved Red Dead Redemption for its pacing and exploration value - watching a good western is cool, but inhabiting one is another thing entirely. I still miss my beautiful horse, killed by a pair of mountain lions, both of which I shot dead and skinned. I hope the developers took note of the stories players told after engaging with the game.
Three short years have passed since the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Xbox One went on sale, but there is an expectation that both consoles will soon be refreshed.
In the past, Microsoft and Sony refined their consoles during their lifecycles with cosmetic changes and occasionally some useful upgrades such as a larger hard drive.
But this time round more significant changes are planned.
Sony revealed to the Financial Times on Friday that it is working on an upgraded PS4 codenamed Neo. It said it would be able to handle 4K output - four times the detail of 1080p high definition - but would not be ready to unveil at E3.
Sony added it would be more expensive than the basic version, which will continue to be made, but did not say by how much.
""I do not believe the new PS4 will be possible of native 4K gaming,"" commented Mr Harding-Rolls.
""The cost implications on both the device and content creation make this unfeasible.
""It is likely to support 4K video - as this is where the majority of 4K content is emerging - and will probably upscale PS4 games to 4K output.
""Whether this upscaling significantly improves the visuals probably depends on the game, the size of the 4K TV it is shown on and the quality of upscaling.""
Gaming blogs have also suggested that a smaller Xbox One could be unveiled at E3.
The console has been criticised for being bulkier than its predecessor, although Microsoft designer Carl Ledbetter has explained the size helps keep the machine cool and allows it to run quietly.
Nintendo has already confirmed it is working on a new console - codenamed NX - but has said it will not be showing  the device at E3.
Virtual reality was expected to steal the show at last year's E3, but despite high-profile backing from the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, gamers with VR headsets are still few and far between.
Headsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are finally making their way onto gamers' faces, so 2016 could be the year that blockbuster titles that attract the masses are announced.
Sony's PlayStation VR is due out in October - perhaps perfectly timed for the highly anticipated space exploration game No Man's Sky to be revealed as a launch title.
Creator Sean Murray has said it would be a ""perfect fit"" for VR, and it has been tested in Oculus - but he has yet to reveal more.
Microsoft currently has no VR hardware of its own, instead focusing on its Hololens augmented reality helmet, which superimposes graphics over real-world views.
But the Xbox controller already works with the Oculus Rift headset, and there is speculation that Microsoft will announce a tie-up with the Oculus platform.
""Microsoft has been looking at an open approach to VR, inviting manufacturers to use its Windows platform to build their businesses on,"" said Mr Harding-Rolls.
""I think it would be a stretch to go from those ideas, to announcing an exclusive agreement to bring a particular VR headset manufacturer to Xbox One.
""But it has to put forward strategies to convince Xbox 360 users who haven't converted yet to upgrade.""
The PS4 has pulled ahead of Xbox One in the console race, so gamers will be watching Microsoft closely for exclusives. Gaming blogs have suggested two series featuring the undead will be revived.
""We're expecting Dead Rising 4, and State of Decay 2 - both have performed well on the Xbox platform before,"" said Tom Phillips, deputy news editor at Eurogamer.
Some of last year's biggest announcements - such as first-person shooter Gears of War 4, and role-playing game Scalebound - have yet to be released.
Sony too has yet to deliver on some of its previous announcements, such as The Last Guardian, a fantasy-adventure about a boy who befriends a cat-bird hybrid creature. It was first announced at E3 in 2009.
""The Last Guardian has achieved an almost mythical quality by this point,"" said Mr Phillips.
""It's finally coming out this year, so hopefully it's the last time we'll see it trailed at E3. But it does feel like when these big games do come out, they are generally well received, as with Uncharted.
""This year, I think we'll see Sony hand over the stage to some of the games it has tie-ins with, such as Call of Duty.""
The military-inspired shooter began as a Windows game in 2003, but now offers some add-on content to PlayStation gamers first.
It's shaping up to be a relatively quiet E3 for Nintendo, but it is likely to attract attention with its much-delayed Legend of Zelda game, with a new quest for the young sword-wielding hero Link.
It is one of the bestselling series of all time, but the latest instalment has been repeatedly delayed. First announced in 2014, is now tipped to be a launch title for the NX console, and could end up being the last big home-grown game Nintendo releases for the Wii U.
Not everything promised at E3 is successfully delivered.
Ubisoft was criticised after its 2012 demo of Watch Dogs featured superior graphics to those that appeared in the released console games.  A San Francisco-set sequel has been teased ahead of E3.
""First time round there was huge interest in the game, but it didn't quite live up to expectations,"" said Mr Phillips.
""Ubisoft has a history of having a good idea but not quite getting it right until the second release, as with Assassin's Creed.
""Hopefully with this sequel they have had time to refine it.""

39278637,"The database is reported to contain information on 100,000 US Department of Defense employees, among others.
Troy Hunt, who published news of the leak, said the information had ""enormous"" potential for scammers.
Business services firm Dun & Bradstreet confirmed to tech news site ZDNet that it owns the data.
Information on government departments and private sector employees is commonly collated by business services that sell the data to other companies, such as marketing firms.
In this case, the records - including names, job titles and contact details - were originally compiled by NetProspex, which was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet in 2015.
Organisations with employees mentioned in the data include the US Postal Service, telecoms giant AT&T and the retailer Walmart.
Mr Hunt pointed out that people might try to use the names and email addresses in the database to scam or retrieve sensitive information from recipients - a practice known as spear phishing.
""The value for very targeted spear phishing is enormous because you can carefully craft messages that refer to specific individuals of influence and their roles within the organisation,"" he wrote on his blog.
Dun & Bradstreet told ZDNet: ""Based on our analysis, it was not accessed or exposed through a Dun & Bradstreet system.""

Violence has intensified since last Sunday when at least 55 people were killed in clashes between police and protesters at an Oromo festival.
Hundreds have died in months of protests, human rights groups say.
Tens of thousands have also been detained, they say.

The protests since last November are for manifold reason, and include:
In the most recent unrest in Oromia, at least 55 people were killed in a stampede.
Opposition activists blame the police for causing panic at the annual Ireecha celebrations - a traditional Oromo religious festival. The government blames ""anti-peace forces"" demonstrating in the crowd.
Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters angered at their handling of the event, witnesses told the BBC.
Protesters say violence by the security forces led to the stampede, but the PM denied security forces had opened fire.

35631380,"Goodwin, who gave Trevor Francis his Blues debut, led the club to two FA Cup semi-finals and promotion to the old Division One in his time in charge, from June 1970 to September 1975.
He had previously been manager of both Scunthorpe United and Brighton.
During his playing career, he was a wing-half for Matt Busby's United, then Leeds before finishing at Scunthorpe.
As one of the Busby Babes, he made his first team breakthrough at Old Trafford following the Munich Air Disaster in 1958.
He played in the first game after Munich, just a fortnight later, when the team-sheet in the programme was famously left blank for the club's FA Cup fifth-round win over Sheffield Wednesday.
And he was in the rebuilt United team all the way to Wembley, where they lost 2-0 to local rivals Bolton Wanderers.
Heywood-born Goodwin also played first-class cricket over two summers, making 11 appearances as a fast bowler for his native Lancashire, in which he took a career-best 5-35 against Middlesex at Lord's in June 1955.
After leaving Birmingham in 1975, Goodwin took up an offer to move to the then burgeoning North American Soccer League, where he had two spells as coach, then club president of the Minnesota Kicks.
He remained in the United States for the rest of his life, and died at home in Gig Harbor, Washington State at the weekend.

25185518,"The US company says the ""limited edition"" Toq is designed to showcase its new technologies rather than compete with its other products.
Qualcomm is best known for making processors that power smartphones.
However, one analyst suggested the device was too bulky to appeal beyond a niche enthusiast audience.
The $349 (Â£215) gadget is being made available via only Qualcomm's website to US customers, and the company said it was ""unlikely"" it would sell the watch elsewhere.
The Toq is designed to be paired with any smartphone running Android 4.0.3 or higher.
It allows its owner to receive and send text messages, manage reminders and view other information - such as weather forecasts or stock prices - obtained via their handset.
There is no software store for the watch itself, but existing handset apps can be adapted to send details to its display and activate a vibrate function. In addition it can be used to accept or reject calls, and control what music is being played from the linked phone's library.
The company says that the watch's key innovation is its use of its proprietary Mirasol technology.
Rob Chandok, president of Qualcomm Interactive Platforms, described this as being similar to the e-ink displays commonly used by e-book readers and another smartwatch - the Pebble - but better.
""In addition to the fact it offers colour, the refresh rate of Mirasol can be 30 frames a second, which allows you to build a touch interface,"" he told the BBC.
""That's tremendously important when you are trying to offer some of these experiences.
""In an e-ink display you can't refresh the screen fast enough to follow the finger.""
Mirasol is significantly less power-hungry than the OLED tech used by Samsung's Galaxy Gear watch, meaning that unlike its rival, its screen does not have to turn itself off when angled away from the user's face to extend battery life.
Sony's Smartwatch 2 does offer an always-on LCD display - however, it requires the user to switch on a backlight in dim conditions.
Although Qualcomm suggests the Toq's lack of an on/off switch makes it the superior option, Mr Chandok acknowledged that the Toq display's graphics were not as vibrant or crisp as the alternatives.
""But we've got other versions of Mirasol in the pipeline that are going to have a better colour gamut and vibrancy,"" he added.
Qualcomm has also included three other technologies it has developed that it hopes will attract the attention of manufacturers:
Mr Chandok said ""tens of thousands, but not hundreds of thousands"" of the watches were being produced, adding that its appeal was likely to be limited to an ""early adopter"" crowd.
""We would consider making more if the demand were high,"" he said. ""But our preference is for our partners to bring out products [using the new technologies] in the next six months, and we're working hard with a few people to do that.""
He declined to name the companies involved, but did reveal that in theory the Toq could be made compatible with Apple's iPhones.
""We limited the spend on what we were doing and just built the applications on the Android side,"" he said.
""There's nothing keeping us from doing an iOS app, we just haven't invested in that.""
Many analysts believe the market in smartwatches and other wearable technologies - such as Google's Glass eyewear - has the potential for huge growth.
The research firm NextMarket Insights has predicted 373 million smartwatches will be shipped in 2020 compared with fewer than one million this year.
However, one expert warned that Qualcomm and others had to make major improvements to achieve such numbers.
""They are still relatively bulky in watch terms and you still have issues with recharging, which is an alien concept to people with watches,"" said Chris Green, an analyst at the consultants Davies Murphy Group.
""The Toq offers a little bit more than some of the other smartwatches in terms of what it can do, but it's still ultimately a basic thing offering little more than a second screen, and is quite gimmicky.
""We've still to see anyone offer a smartwatch that delivers something that we actually need.""",Qualcomm has released a smartwatch that it says can last days between recharges despite the fact its touchscreen display is always on.

10620352,"She has lost her British citizenship and exclusion is expected to follow, meaning she cannot travel to the UK.
Ms Chapman was among 10 Russians arrested in the US who admitted to being agents for a foreign country.
Last week her lawyer said she would like to come to the UK as she has a UK passport through a previous marriage.
Russia agreed to exchange four US spies for the 10 Russian agents and the swap was carried out in Vienna on 9 July.
Ms Chapman, who is also known as Anya Kushchenko, is the daughter of a Russian diplomat.
Until the Home Office's decision, she had dual Russian-UK nationality.
BBC home affairs correspondent Andy Tighe said Ms Chapman became the best-known of the Russian spy ring after details and photographs from her Facebook entry were picked up by newspapers around the world.
He said her lawyers were handed a letter formally revoking her citizenship and she was told her passport was no longer valid.
It is understood steps are also being taken to permanently exclude Ms Chapman from travelling to the UK in the future, our correspondent said.
Earlier this month, Briton Alex Chapman, 30, from Bournemouth, Dorset, talked to a newspaper about his four-year marriage to the 28-year-old Russian.
He said they had met at a party in London in 2002 and married five months later.
He said she changed dramatically during the marriage, and by the end was having ""secretive"" meetings with ""Russian friends"".
Ms Chapman did not seek to conceal her Russian identity when she arrived in New York from Moscow in February 2010, saying she wanted to build up a recruitment agency targeting young professionals in both cities.
But following the Vienna spy swap, a Home Office spokesperson had said they were reviewing Ms Chapman's passport situation.
Russian agents' all-American lives
Viewpoint: Life after spying
'Russian spy suspect was my wife'
""The home secretary has the right to deprive dual nationals of their British citizenship where she considers that to do so would be conducive to the public good. This case is under urgent consideration,"" the spokesperson said.
Shadow home secretary Alan Johnson had said it ""cannot be in our interests"" to let Ms Chapman settle in the UK.
The BBC's Dominic Casciani said only half a dozen people have been stripped of British citizenship since the law was introduced in 2002. The law was partly introduced to make it easier to deport radical cleric Abu Hamza al Masri.
The home secretary can strip someone of citizenship if their presence is ""seriously prejudicial"" to British interests: for example, if they are a threat to national security.
The 10 Russian agents had pleaded guilty in New York to ""conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of a foreign country"".
More serious money-laundering charges against them were dropped.
Prosecutors said the accused had posed as ordinary citizens, some living together as couples for years, and were ordered by Russia's External Intelligence Service (SVR) to infiltrate policy-making circles and collect information.
On Sunday it was reported that two of the four Russians expelled from Moscow as part of the spy swap were believed to be staying undercover in a British hotel.
The brother of one, Igor Sutyagin, said he had called his wife from a small town on the edge of London, but had not been told exactly where he was.","Anna Chapman, one of the Russian spies deported from the United States, has been deprived of her British citizenship, the BBC understands."
34002641,"Professor Alexis Jay's report detailed how girls as young as 11 were raped, trafficked, abducted, beaten, and intimidated, predominantly by men of Pakistani-heritage.
It said there had been ""blatant"" collective failures by the council's leadership, a failure by South Yorkshire Police to prioritise the issue and said senior managers had ""underplayed"" the scale of the problem.
The report prompted a raft of resignations and further inquiries, one of which led to the council being taken over by government-appointed commissioners.
But, 12 months on, BBC News asked those most closely involved what has changed in Rotherham?
Jessica, not her real name, said she was first abused when she aged just 12.
Since the report was published, she believes there has been ""real change"" in the way the authorities deal with victims of child sexual exploitation (CSE).
""We're now being listened to, there's more support in place and survivors and their families are now on board and helping agencies shape services,"" she said.
""We're telling them what we need and what's going to help us move forward.""
However, she said more needed to be done and called for ""mandatory education"" for children on the dangers of grooming and increased funding for police forces.
""I know a lot of people find it difficult to trust the authorities but I do think things are really changing now,"" she continued.
""I think the way people look at abuse is changing and I think the authorities recognise that it's not the victim's fault, it's not the parents' fault and that the perpetrators are the ones to blame.""
In a video message posted on Rotherham Council's website, council leader Chris Read said: ""We've begun to make the changes that we need and we are making progress. We've been listening and we are acting.
""Our child sexual exploitation team has been rebuilt and we're working more closely than ever with our partners to deliver the services that people need and deserve.
""We are rebuilding our council so it can't fail so badly ever again.""
Ian Thomas was appointed director of children's services at the council in January, following the resignation of Joyce Thacker.
""When you look at where we've come in the last few months it's been a long way, especially when you look at the amount of services in place now for victims and survivors,"" he said.
""We're supporting around 300 victims and survivors of CSE through investing over half a million pounds.
""But, let me be very, very clear - we still have a long way to go.""
Dr Alan Billings was elected as South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) in October 2014 following the resignation of Shaun Wright.
Since then he has set up a ""Victims, Survivors and Families panel"" to allow those affected by CSE in Rotherham to discuss their experiences with officers.
In June, he also appointed Prof John Drew to lead an independent review of South Yorkshire Police's handling of CSE reports.
""I think very few of us understood the nature of grooming, the police ought to have done, but I don't think we did,"" he said.
""One of the things that has changed is that we do now recognise what grooming is.
""It's not about girls who are out of control, who are disrespectful of authority, who are incorrigible in their behaviour and have to be treated in that way - it's about young people who are victims.
""We understand that now and that's been a huge shift in understanding and that's very important.""
Since his appointment 62 additional officers had been put to work in the Public Protection Unit.
Since the report's publication, Ch Supt Jason Harwin said South Yorkshire Police now ""understands the needs and support required"" by victims.
He said Dr Billings' panel was helping officers understand ""what we need to do differently"".
""I've got a responsibility to make sure I do everything and my staff do everything to make sure they feel [victims] have got the confidence to come forward and, when they do, they are treated with respect, with dignity and, ultimately, helped to get through the challenge that they face,"" he said.
Since August 2014, eight men have been charged with more than 100 offences as part of Operation Clover, the force's investigation into CSE in Rotherham.
Mr Harwin said: ""The last 12 months have been horrific for Rotherham, particularly for the victims and survivors, and it has sent shockwaves through the community.
""The important thing that has been changing in the past 12 months is that communities know that they have got a key part to play in making sure we identify those responsible and, with the work we've been doing around education and increasing awareness, we're seeing now more information coming forward to police.
""We're committed to doing everything we can to bring these people to justice and we are bringing people to justice.""
Report author Prof Jay said: ""I hope that my report has contributed to significant awareness-raising, both by the public and professionals and that it should not be dismissed as scarcely a crime but that it is a very, very serious crime and should be treated as such.
""My report did bring child sexual exploitation sharply in to the public domain and I would like to think of that as an achievement, but there are lots of other people who have been working hard to try to get recognition for it. I think that's probably the most important aspect.
""Secondly, I would say the support for known victims and survivors has had more investment put in to it, but I do not think it is there yet in terms of meeting their needs.
""We simply do not know what the volume of demand for this kind of therapeutic help will be, but it's increased significantly in the last year so that's important as well that more money has been made available to provide this kind of support to those who so desperately need it.""","It has been a year since a report found at least 1,400 children were subjected to appalling sexual abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013."

The English local council seats up for grabs were won at the height of Labour's popularity under Ed Miliband - though that's not saying a great deal. Now, losses look inevitable, and a pantheon of psephologists predict 150, 190, more?
Mr Corbyn's Labour enemies have set the bar for respectability impossibly high.
Four hundred gains are the minimum to show progress, according to the likes of defeated leadership contender Liz Kendall, and given the fact Labour's trailing the Conservatives in the national polls, she might as well have demanded 400,000.
If Labour comes third in Scotland - though that's not thought very likely - or loses in London - something almost no-one expects to happen, the hair-rending and teeth-gnashing will be so frenzied as to leave the entire Labour Party, Corbynistas and anti-Corbynistas alike, bald and toothless.
As it is, we can expect a cacophonous set of rival choruses. Those loyal to the leader blaming the disloyalty of dissident MPs for vote-sapping disunity. And those who want the leader gone blaming him; demanding a change of direction and some a change of leader.
There's no plan among the mutineers in waiting to move against Mr Corbyn this side of the European referendum. That would smack too much of treachery with a defining struggle for Britain still to be won and lost.
Will they strike afterwards?
Will any MP risk the certain wrath of Mr Corbyn's army of loyal supporters subsequently?
From all I hear, at least two and possibly more Labour MPs of vintage and deep anti-Corbyn conviction, have told friends and colleagues that they will.
As of now - tonight - a challenge looks to me more than a plausible possibility. But let's see.
Remember Michael Foot? Remember Gordon Brown at the nadir of his fortunes? Yes, Labour dumped Tony Blair, but he had a truly dedicated and ruthlessly ambitious replacement in Mr Brown (and the compromises he forced on the party grated horribly with the faithful well before Iraq). Put bluntly, Labour has always been rubbish at regicide.
This time, as far as I can detect, the mood is different.
Something damaging and conceivably dangerous for the Labour leader is about to happen. Will it end with the Labour leader's position damaged or even strengthened, at least internally?
With the Labour faithful, the ordinary members new and old, who elected Jeremy Corbyn in the first place in no mood to dump him, the chances of a challenge succeeding look remote. That doesn't mean the mutineers won't try.
As for the Conservatives, David Cameron's enjoying an easier ride than any leader of a governing party as divided as the Conservatives has any right to expect.
Split and bitterly fractious over Europe, some feeling rebellious over bossy and, it's argued, ""un-Conservative"" plans to force through academisation of schools and push hard for more elected mayors, the Tories really ought to be struggling, oughtn't they?
And what about the continuing austerity of the chancellor's two-steps-forward-and-one-step back drive towards deficit reduction?
The prime minister must be offering a prayer a day in thanks for Labour's troubles. If he doesn't, he needs to start.
The Liberal Democrats? They're used to fighting with their backs against the wall and, for Tim Farron, that's just as well. At least they can scarcely do worse than they did in May 2015 at the general election, and they won't.
UKIP may have passed their high water mark. But they'll hope for something to cheer about, in Wales at the very least. Then, after the referendum, Nigel Farage will get on with his dream of redesigning and rebranding his party.
It's up the voters in the end, isn't it. The ones who bother to vote, anyway. Wonder what they've made of it all?","A bad night, and a worse morning ahead for the Labour Party."
27316009,"Her husband, 29-year-old Aash Bahadur Gurung, was one of the Sherpa climbing guides caught up when a huge mass of snow suddenly gave way a few hundred metres above Everest Base Camp as they prepared for the climbing season.
""I still feel he's alive,"" the 25-year-old told the BBC, struggling to control her tears as she carried her 10-month-old son, Anish Gurung.
""Before going to Everest, he said it was his last time to work as a guide.
""He wanted to go to America. He wanted to make some money and make our lives better.""
Sixteen Sherpas lost their lives on 18 April in what has been described by many as modern mountaineering's deadliest single tragedy. Three of them have not been found and are presumed dead.
Since the avalanche, more than 300 international climbers have abandoned their plans to scale Mount Everest - the world's highest mountain at 8,848m (29,029ft), which straddles the border between China and Nepal.
Nepal's tourism and mountaineering authorities have been left high and dry.
Anita Lama, 23, is the widow of Asman Tamang, 26, who also died on the mountain.
""I never thought that such a tragedy would happen,"" she told the BBC, her eyes welling up as she carried her daughter, 11-month-old Dolma Tamang.
""He started going to the mountains for work for the past four years or so.
""Before the accident he said he would come back after two months. He was planning to build our own house after a couple of years.""
After the disaster struck, the Nepali government announced a compensation and insurance package worth about $15,000 (£8,800) to the families of the Sherpa climbers.
But the families and friends of those killed were not satisfied.
Nimi Sherpa, who is a climber herself and an aunt of Phurba Ongyal Sherpa, 25, who also died in the avalanche, said the government had insulted the country's climbing community by initially announcing compensation worth merely $400 (£238).
""We are being treated like beggars,"" she said.
""We were treated miserably in the past, too, that's why many Sherpas have left the country.""
Nepal's Himalayan Sherpa people are believed to have migrated from eastern Tibet centuries ago, and their population in Nepal currently stands at just over 112,000, according to Nepal's Population and Housing Census 2011.
The term ""Sherpa"" is now widely used to identify a climbing guide, and not all come from the ethnic Sherpa community of Solukhumbu, the district where Mount Everest is located.
According to the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA), around 9,000 Sherpas are engaged in mountaineering working as guides and climbing aides, and they make between $5,000 (£3,000) and $7,000 each climbing season - several times higher than the average Nepali income.
But the job is fraught with risks and there is no proper official social security arrangements, senior Sherpas say, so thousands have chosen to migrate to greener pastures.
Many have gone to America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and others to neighbouring India.
After the avalanche, Nepal's tourism and mountaineering officials were unable to persuade the 300 international climbers at the Everest Base Camp to continue climbing.
""All climbers have packed up and left the base camp by now,"" Ang Tshering Sherpa, president of the NMA, told the BBC.
""But the expedition plans from the Chinese side of the mountain are on.""
In recent years, Nepal's tourism ministry has been earning an annual sum of more than $3m (£1.7m) from the climbers heading to Mount Everest alone.
After the disaster on 18 April, officials decided to extend the permits issued this year for five years. They also announced better rescue and security measures for mountaineers.
As well as the security measures, the government announced education and welfare benefits for the families of those Sherpas killed.
But 77-year-old Nima Sherpa, who lost her youngest son, Ang Kaji Sherpa, 37, in the avalanche, is still worried that her six grandchildren may suffer.
""He went to the Himal [mountain] to make money, earn daily bread for the family, build a house. Now who will do that?"" she asked, as she joined prayers organised in memory of her son at a Sherpa monastery in Kathmandu.
Her granddaughters Chhechi Sherpa, 19, and Sumi Sherpa, 15, go to school in Kathmandu, but now, after the sudden death of their father, they are worried about their future.
""The government must help us complete our education,"" Chhechi said. ""It must also give us facilities such as taking up government jobs.""
In the weeks since the avalanche, some Sherpas at the Everest Base Camp have demanded seats in parliament and access to civil service roles such as mountain liaison officer assignments - a job assigned to mostly non-Sherpa Nepali officials until now.
Tourism Minister Bhim Acharya responded to this, saying: ""The government is serious about the demands put forth by our brave Sherpa climbers. We are doing whatever we can.
""But as far as a government job without the proper qualifications and education is concerned, that's not possible because we have to follow the rules and laws.""
Wangchu Sherpa, president of Nepal Climbers Association, says it is not always fair to blame the government for all the problems facing the Sherpa community.
""There was no provision for compensation until a few years ago,"" he said. ""Gradually things are improving for the Sherpas. There are provisions for compensations, education and welfare. That's a good thing.""
Shailee Basnet, a member of Nepal's all-women expedition team called Seven Summits Women Team, thinks emotions are too raw now.
""The Sherpas will go back to Everest again next year,"" she said. ""That's why the government and the climbing operators must ensure the technical, social and economic safety of the Sherpa climbers.""
Ang Tshering, president of the NMA, told the BBC he welcomed the government's efforts, and said his organisation had decided to set up a separate trust worth $100,000 (£60,000) for the bereaved families.
But he said the association was calling for the insurance package for Sherpa climbers to be increased to $2m (£1.2m).
Since the 1960s, Nepal's Sherpa community has increasingly received support from international groups.
New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary, who became the first man to reach the summit of Everest in 1953 along with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, founded the Himalayan Trust in 1960, which helped to build airstrips, schools and hospitals in the Everest region. Since then other charitable individuals and organisations have followed suit.
International climbers have continued to show warmth and support since last month's avalanche. Japanese climber Ken Noguchi gave $100,000 (£60,000) towards the education and welfare of the deceased Sherpas' families.
""It's very sad that the Sherpas went to the extent of boycotting climbing expeditions this year,"" Mr Noguchi told the BBC. ""It probably reflects their long pent up anger and resentment.
""It's good to see the government and the mountaineering association extending support to them.... Such incidents shouldn't happen in the future.""","Menuka Magar-Gurung is struggling to come to terms with what happened on that bright, sunny morning."
21032595,"It follows proposals put forward last year in a review for an overhaul of police pay, conditions and allowances.
The Police Federation says it is ""disappointed"" by the announcement.
What are the key changes?
The recommendations of the mammoth two-part Winsor Review of police pay had one simple aim: to stop paying police officers for the time they have served and start paying them for their skills and the challenges they face. In other words - the days of paying an officer more just because he had done 28 years would go.
The first part of the review said police were being paid under a system that had been devised for a world that no longer existed. Forces have shifted resources increasingly into specialised units. That's because (broadly speaking) expert teams - be they officers working on burglary intelligence or those who deal with child abuse - should be able to amass the knowledge needed to solve more crimes more quickly.
Winsor said that reforming pay and conditions would help chiefs to focus resources where they were needed, while preventing some officers from seeking out the easiest of posts.
The second part of the review called for chiefs to be able to make officers redundant - a fundamental shift in the employment protection enjoyed by sworn officers. it also called for physical fitness tests and direct entry into senior ranks for recruits with relevant outside experience - be it military or business management skills. He also wanted accelerated promotion to inspector for the best recruits, to encourage more top graduates into policing.
Police pay is set through a national negotiating board - and disputes go to a arbitration tribunal.
There were a number of sticking points during the negotiations:
The government said that pay needed to be based on skills and how they were used, rather than number of years served. It said forces needed this flexibility because of the different challenges each area of the country faced. Although forces were broadly on track to make spending cuts of up to 20% by March 2015, that was not guaranteed.
Starting salaries will be cut by up to £4,259 from April, making the starting salary £19,000. This salary will be given to those with the least or no relevant experience - such as those who join at 18. But some recruits will start on £22,000 if they have some experience, such as time spent as a special constable. The change in starting salaries will save an estimated £140m over five years.
But the deal also means that many constables will have the opportunity to move to the top of the pay scale -  currently around £36,000 - more quickly, .
The Police Federation which represents rank-and-file officers says this cut in starting salary fails to reflect the dangers inherent in the job and that police constables have lost out because of an unfair comparison between their jobs and those of other public sector workers.
From April, chief constables will have discretion over whether to pay officers regional allowances. Currently, all officers in the Metropolitan and City of London police get a ""London allowance"" which amounts to an extra £4,338. Officers in other forces in south-east England get an extra payment of between £1,000 and £3,000.
But in the future it will be up to the chiefs of those forces whether to continue paying that. An additional allowance in the capital, known as ""London weighting"" stays.
All officers from constable to chief inspector can apply for a special payment of £1,212 when they reach the top of the pay grade. The idea was that it would act as an incentive for officers at the top of their scales to carry on working hard.
This payment for the lower ranks was introduced following a deal to give bonuses to police chiefs. But nine out of 10 eligible officers receive the payment. Critics say that means the payment has in effect become a rise for time served. From April, CRTP will be phased out, saving an estimated £73m in the first year.
Constables can't be made redundant. The Winsor Review called for chief constables to be able to get rid of officers to help them make sure they have the right mix of officers and other staff. This is a highly controversial area and negotiations will continue.
The Home Office has decided that there should be direct entry into some of the higher echelons of the police, rather than forcing every recruit to go through the same lengthy career that begins with being a constable. The idea is to encourage more, older, people from a range of backgrounds into the police, particularly high-flying graduates.
The Home Office will start a consultation soon on how direct entry will work.",The Home Secretary is implementing a range of major reforms to police pay in England and Wales after two years of tense negotiations between officers and government.
37605661,"While opinion is divided, Mrs Clinton is largely thought to have come out on top in Sunday's debate in St Louis. But columnists raised the issue of her failure to tackle Mr Trump effectively, allowing him to ""exceed expectations"".
""The smiling Hillary we saw throughout the first debate on Long Island? She didn't make the trip west.""
Fox News concludes that Mr Trump managed to pull off a surprising performance, although the news channel does not explicitly state that the Republican candidate won the debate.
The conservative network says he performed well, pivoting and manoeuvring through questions, allowing him to save his presidential hopes.
Political analyst William Whelan said the night fell into the hands of Mr Trump.
He said the Republican defended his record and unlike the first debate, when he was often blown off course by the former secretary of state and ""torpedoed by his own badgering performance"", he improved as the night went on.
Mr Trump's decision to launch a blistering attack against Hillary Clinton and her husband is described by Fox as the equivalent of ""Hillary dropping Alicia Machado on Trump"" in the previous debate.
That was the line used by Breitbart news, which is in a minority in handing the title to Mr Trump.
In a leading story quoting comments from former mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, it reports that Mrs Clinton was ""pounded on bad decisions"".
It refers to accusations from Mr Trump that Mrs Clinton and the Democratic Party helped ""create the vacuum in the Middle East"" that allowed so-called Islamic State to form.
The hard-right news website, whose executive chairman Stephen Bannon was appointed Mr Trump's campaign chief in August, is running its own readers' poll, the results of which have yet to be announced.
The site also highlights support from Republican vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence, who said in a tweet that he was proud of Mr Trump and congratulated him on ""a big debate win"", while ending it with a shortened form of Mr Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan.
""All Hillary Clinton had to do was remain upright for 90 minutes.""
The Washington Post's verdict is that the debate highlighted an ""increasingly isolated"" Mr Trump during an ""unusually dark and bitter face-off"". Over the past year, the newspaper has been at the forefront of investigations into Mr Trump, and has published several editorials condemning the candidate.
On the news site's Right Turn blog, Jennifer Rubin says Mrs Clinton had very little to do in order to go ""the last little way in wrapping up the election"".
She writes that Mrs Clinton handled the audience well when answering questions, adding that the former secretary of state effectively won the debate early on by ""simply keeping her cool"".
Issues ranging from Mr Trump's tax payments to his foreign policy have, according to the Post, given Mrs Clinton plenty of material for a new raft of political ads.
In a separate piece for the Post, opinion writer Eugene Joseph Dionne Jr writes that Mr Trump's ""petulant"" and ""boorish"" approach on the night was an indication of ""a man aware that his campaign was at the edge of extinction"".
""It took the nastiest, most bitterly personal presidential debate in recent memory for the Republican nominee to stanch the downward plunge"" - so writes Stephen Collinson for CNN.
He says that Mr Trump will live to fight another day ""after throwing out a battery of vicious counter punches"", while US politics ""changed in the course of one nasty night"".
Meanwhile a CNN/ORC poll of debate watchers handed Sunday's victory to Mrs Clinton. But the results also showed that Mr Trump managed to exceed expectations.
Mrs Clinton took the win with 57% of the vote, the poll says, while Mr Trump managed to achieve 34%. The result could be considered a disappointment for Mrs Clinton, who scored 62% in the first presidential debate.
The Atlantic, which endorsed Mrs Clinton last week, suggests that Mr Trump suffered an ""implosion"" in St Louis on Sunday.
Ron Fournier, whose coverage of US politics dates back to the days of Bill Clinton, writes that Mrs Clinton did about as well as anyone could while dealing with a ""barking"" opponent and ""pouting menace"".
Mr Fournier said that throughout the debate the controversial Republican ""failed to patch together his collapsing campaign"".
The website suggests that Mrs Clinton perfectly handled Mr Trump's comment about ""instructing my attorney general to get a special prosecutor"" to look into allegations that she deleted thousands of emails in violation of a congressional subpoena.
Mrs Clinton laughed and said it was a good thing ""somebody with Donald Trump's temperament"" doesn't have such power.
""Nothing hurts a bully like somebody laughing at him,"" the column says.",The US media have given their verdict on who won the second presidential debate after Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton engaged in attack and counter-attack.

32452617,"Shaun McKerry tried to rob Shildon Post Office in County Durham on 15 March.
CCTV showed the 31-year-old threatening staff with the axe before shopkeeper Sab Dhillon tackled him to the floor and restrained him.
Durham Crown Court heard McKerry, of Coundon, near Bishop Auckland, had earlier admitted attempted robbery.
McKerry, whose face was hidden by a scarf and hood, brandished the weapon as he ordered shop assistant Andrea Brighty to fill a bag with money from the till, the court heard.
But Mr Dhillon ran from a back office, grabbed McKerry from behind and wrestled him to the floor.
The court heard McKerry, dubbed Boomerang Boy because of his repeated spells in prison, had been arrested more than 80 times.
He was told he must serve an extended four-year licence period after he is released.
The court was told McKerry started shoplifting at the age of 12 and by 15 he had been arrested 80 times, and had convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary.
McKerry once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave.
Dramatic CCTV footage from the shop showed the masked McKerry waving an axe as he demanded cash from terrified assistant Andrea Brighty.
But he did not see Mr Dhillon's rugby tackle, which dropped him to the floor, sending shelves and produce tumbling.
As the men wrestled, and with McKerry still holding the axe, Mr Dhillon's wife Sam helped, hitting him twice with a baseball bat to make him drop the weapon.
Blood can be seen coming from the would-be robber's nose and Mr Dhillon gestured to his wife to drop the bat.
Minutes later the police arrived and arrested McKerry, who, the court heard, had been arrested more than 80 times and had 64 previous convictions.
Speaking to BBC Tees shortly after the raid, Mr Dhillon said: ""I was in the back storeroom on the computer and I heard Andrea, who was behind the counter shouting 'no, no, no'.
""I saw a guy waiving an axe at her. I came up behind him and pulled him away from Andrea and the counter. We struggled, fell on the floor.
""I managed to keep hold of him and get the axe off him and hold him there until the police arrived.""
During his summing up in court, Judge Christopher Prince described Mr Dhillion's actions as a ""conspicuous display of bravery.""
The court was told McKerry's history of offending also included burglary, assaulting a police officer, attempted robbery and criminal damage.",A serial criminal who was brought to the ground by the owner of a shop during a failed axe raid has been jailed for six years.
38239138,"Haki Africa said the figure could be higher but some families were reluctant to come forward for fear of victimisation by state security agents.
The police oversight body said 52 officers were on trial in connection with such killings countrywide.
The coastal region has suffered several terror attacks in recent years.
The Somali Islamist militant al-Shabab group has been targeting Kenya over the deployment of Kenyan forces to Somalia.
Most of the victims were youths including returnees from Somalia who had surrendered after the government promised them amnesty, Haki Africa's report said.
Others were allegedly killed as a result of excessive use of force during police crackdowns on protests and other religious groups that had been accused of radicalising young people.
Saada Suleiman, who attended the report's launch in the capital, Nairobi, said her husband had been missing for two years since his arrest in a raid on Masjid Musa mosque in Mombasa known for its radical sermons.
Haki Africa Executive Director Hussein Khalid said some of those killed were terror suspects, including several radical Muslim clerics, but this was no excuse for the state to execute them without due process.
The BBC's Abdinoor Aden in the capital, Nairobi, says officers from the anti-terror unit have been heavily implicated in the report.
Murshid Nassir, who heads the National Police Service Commission which vets officers, told the BBC that so-called ""death squads"" did not exist within the force and extrajudicial killings were not condoned.
While the chairman of the Independent Policing Oversight Authority promised to take action against officers found guilty of engaging in the killings.
Macharia Njeru said 52 officers had been charged and more than 300 officers were being probed for gross human rights violations.","Kenya's anti-terror police have carried out at least 81 extrajudicial killings in country's mainly Muslim coastal region since 2012, a rights group says."
30347441,"The top places are invariably filled with the US and UK academic powerhouses. And then coming up fast are the ambitious Asian universities.
But what about the French, with their centuries of scholarship and ancient institutions? There was a university in Paris before Oxford or Cambridge.
French universities are conspicuous by their absence. In the most recent QS World University Rankings there were none in the top 20 and only two in the top 100.
That could all change from next year.
As part of a huge government-driven academic and economic project, there will be a new university called Paris-Saclay, with a campus south of the French capital. The project has initial funding of 7.5bn euros (Â£5.9bn) for an endowment, buildings and transport links.
The French government is bringing together 19 institutions into a single structure, with the aim of building a university big enough to compete with global giants like Harvard or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Dominique Vernay, the president of this new university, says that within a decade he wants Paris-Saclay to be among the top ranking world universities.
""My goal is to be a top 10 institution,"" he says. In Europe, he wants Paris-Saclay to be in the ""top two or three"".
In university rankings, big is beautiful, and the Paris-Saclay will have 70,000 students and 10,000 researchers. There will be an emphasis on graduate courses and recruiting more international students and staff.
More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch
The idea of bringing together individual colleges into a ""federal university"" has been borrowed from the UK.
""Our model isn't that far from the Oxbridge model,"" he says.
To put it into scale, Mr Vernay says Paris-Saclay is going to be twice the size of the University of California, Berkeley, one of the flagships of the US university system.
Without any extra investment, he says that the existing component parts of the university will put Paris-Saclay straight into the top 20 of the Shanghai global university rankings.
It will inherit staff with Nobel Prizes and some very well-established founding partners, including the Ecole Polytechnique, the HEC Paris business school and the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).
Getting into the top end of the league tables is not the purpose of the investment, he says. But it would be an important indicator of how France can create a much more concentrated and globally competitive research base.
The big idea is to create a ""knowledge hub"" around Paris, bringing together top-level universities with research institutes, hi-tech businesses and start-ups.
The classic example of such a project would be Silicon Valley in California where Stanford University has been the launchpad for firms such as Google and Hewlett Packard.
Boston would be seen as another such hi-tech cluster, with Harvard and MIT feeding ideas into technology firms. In London, Imperial College and University College London are planning expansions to tap into this drive for innovation.
But in this industrial geography of the internet age, with the emergence of these academic-industrial complexes, Paris has been falling behind.
""The essence of the plan is that we are missing growth in France. It's not the big companies, what we're missing is the new technology, those small companies that grow very fast and become new players,"" said Mr Vernay.
""We need to strengthen the links with industry, strengthen our ability to launch start-ups.""
The president says that the Paris-Saclay project should be seen as part of the next great historic wave of French higher education.
The grand ecole that produced the scientists and administrators for Napoleon's empire were very successful specialist institutions. And investment after World War Two supported more research in specialist areas, such as nuclear power.
But Mr Vernay says they have been too small, too disparate and lacking in co-ordination to compete in the modern, globalised economy.
He likens it to a ""French garden"", with different types of flowers growing in splendid isolation.
""There is a very fragmented landscape. We want to re-group institutions so that they can run as a single organisation, in terms of strategy, research and training.""
Another barrier to overcome has been the past reluctance to use anything except the French language.
The common language of higher education, particularly in the sciences, has increasingly become English.
""I am very pragmatic,"" he says. That now means that Paris-Saclay will be offering master's courses fully taught in English as well as French.
""It's not only allowed, it's now encouraged to teach in English.""
From next year, degrees from the constituent colleges will begin to be awarded by Paris-Saclay.
Preparing the 1,300-acre campus, he says is like organising the building of a town. The Paris metro is being extended, linking the university with the city and Orly airport.
In some ways it's a very French response to globalisation.
Paris-Saclay will be part of a chain of centrally planned, academic ""grand projets"", fast-tracking research in the way that a generation ago France was building high-speed railways or the monumental architectural projects in Paris.
The ambition is about safeguarding an uncertain future for France.
""We want to give something back to our country. We are in an economic war,"" says Mr Vernay.",Imagine the chagrin of French universities whenever international rankings are published.
26015532,"Mr Schleicher, who runs the tests, says the high results of deprived pupils in some Asian countries shows what poor pupils in the UK could achieve.
The most disadvantaged pupils in Shanghai match the maths test results of wealthy pupils in the UK.
Mr Schleicher says it ""debunks the myth that poverty is destiny"".
On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove said individual schools in England should take Pisa tests, so that they could compare themselves against international standards.
The latest Pisa - Programme for International Student Assessment - test results were published last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranking developed countries in terms of how well 15-year-olds performed in tests in reading, maths and science.
Source: OECD
This showed the UK as a middle-ranking country, with Asian school systems, such as in Singapore, South Korea and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, as the highest performers.
But Mr Schleicher's latest analysis compares the performance of the most deprived 10% of pupils.
This reveals how the poorest in many countries overlap with the results of the wealthy in other countries.
The poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers taking the test in the UK and the United States.
In Europe, the Netherlands has the highest-performing pupils from the poorest families.
Poor pupils in the Netherlands are as good at maths as much better-off teenagers in France.
The poorest 10% of pupils in Hong Kong scored at a higher level than the wealthiest in Sweden and Norway.
The very lowest performers among this group were in the Slovak Republic.
Mr Schleicher says it shows how academic differences attributed to social background should not be unquestioningly tolerated.
""We tend to overestimate the impact of poverty,"" he says .
There was also a challenge to the idea that the UK has an unusually poor record on social mobility.
Dr John Jerrim at the Institute of Education published a study suggesting that in international terms the UK was mid-ranking in the link between family background and future employment opportunities - 17th out of 34 developed countries.
There was greater equity in Scandinavia and some European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands.
But Dr Jerrim said social mobility in the UK was not dissimilar to France, Spain and Italy - and the UK's record was better than some central and eastern European countries.
""Policymakers often state that the relationship between family background and labour market earnings is stronger in the UK than most other countries,"" he said.
""It is not true that we stand out compared to the rest of world. Policymakers should avoid making such exaggerated claims when discussing this politically sensitive issue.""","There is nothing inevitable about the weaker academic performance of poorer pupils, says an analysis of Pisa tests by the OECD's Andreas Schleicher."

Rachael Haynes (52) and Jess Cameron (75) had earlier made half-centuries for the Aussies, with some late-order hitting from Perry and Jodie Fields taking them to 259-7.
By contributing with the bat and then starring with the ball, Perry made a dramatic return to the Southern Stars' line-up after three games out with an ankle injury.
The last of those was an eight-run defeat by West Indies, their first win over Australia and the result that sealed their place in a maiden final.
Because of that victory, Windies skipper Aguilleira said her side had a ""psychological advantage"" over the team that had lifted the trophy on five previous occasions.
But Australia were too clinical for a West Indies side that were sloppy in the field, wayward with the ball and unable to keep up with the run chase.

It is the first time they have held all three of women's cricket's major titles simultaneously.
Only once in the match were they under pressure, as four wickets fell for 28 runs around the batting powerplay.
""If an emerging sport needs a star to help raise its profile, then women's cricket has struck gold with Ellyse Perry. An international in both cricket and football, the 22-year-old also somehow manages to find time to present shows on radio and television as well as studying for an economics and social sciences degree.""

Before that, Haynes, who added 52 for the first wicket with Meg Lanning, shared a second-wicket stand of 64 with Cameron.
With fielding mistakes and ill-disciplined bowling hampering the Windies, powerful right-hander Cameron played some particularly eye-catching strokes, going past 50 with two sixes in one Tremayne Smartt over.
By this point, Haynes had been well held by Kyshona Knight, running back at mid-wicket to give impressive leg-spinner Shaquana Quintyne her first wicket, and Alex Blackwell had fallen cheaply to Smartt.
Cameron dominated a fourth-wicket partnership of 55 with Sthalekar but, when Cameron slapped a Shanel Daley full toss to deep mid-wicket, Australia lost their way.
With the bowlers finally able to gain some control, Sthalekar, Sarah Coyte and Erin Osborne all found ways to hole out to West Indies fielders.
However, from 209-7 Fields and Perry combined to add 50 exactly, Perry hitting a maximum over long on and skipper Fields improvising with sweeps and pulls.
The Windies batters were always likely to have to deal with movement in the Mumbai night, but openers Natasha Mclean and Kycia Knight looked comfortable until the introduction of Perry.
With no small sense of theatre, the right-armer twice aborted attempts to bowl her first delivery before trapping Knight lbw with a delivery that would have missed the left-hander's off stump.
Limping between overs, Perry then had the dangerous Stefanie Taylor caught and bowled, pinned McLean plumb in front and finished with figures of 3-19.

After Knight retired because of a quad injury, Aguilleira and Dottin counter-attacked, the former sweeping Osborne into the stands and the latter twice taking Coyte over the leg side.
But both were bowled as Sthalekar found turn with her off-breaks, the wicket of Dottin effectively ending the contest.
Sthalekar wrapped the match up when she took a spectacular one-handed catch at short mid-wicket to dismiss Smartt off the bowling of Julie Hunter.

They will only apply to yellow cards shown for dissent, and will see players leave the field for 10 minutes.
It will also be tested in Sunday League and male and female youth football.
More than 1,000 clubs received emails over the weekend asking if they were willing to be part of the pilot process.
""There has already been a positive response with over 60 leagues in support of it,"" an FA spokesperson said.
Clubs are normally charged a £10 fine for each yellow card but the FA will not be charging this administration fee for those that participate.
Step seven is the bottom level of English football's National League System, which feeds into the country's professional leagues.
The highest league within that structure - step one - is the National League.
The move has been backed by teenage Sunday League referee Ryan Hampson, who earlier this year organised a nationwide strike by officials in protest at the amount of abuse they face in the grassroots game.

30931243,"Luck was shining on Public Service Broadcasting when they came to writing the follow up to their 2013 debut album Inform-Educate-Entertain.
The band had previously worked with the British Film Institute in sourcing archive recordings to sample, and they turned to BFI again in their hunt for material from the Cold War space race.
""At the time I called them up to ask them if they had any space footage they'd only just inherited it from another collection,"" said J Willgoose.
""One of my biggest concerns about writing this album was about finding the material for the Soviet missions.
""It was an incredible stroke of luck that the BFI happened to come across these films just as I started asking after them.""
A fan of space exploration, Willgoose was familiar with the battles between the USA and USSR to beat one another to historic firsts.
The Soviets got the first satellite into space in the 1950s and the first man in the 1960s, while the Nasa's Apollo missions put the first men on the Moon.
But Willgoose was still surprised by what was in the BFI's newly-acquired collection.
He said: ""Most of the Soviet stuff was new to me - even now it's hard to find a great deal of good quality literature or footage of their missions because their space programme was shrouded in such secrecy.
""A good deal of the material from the Apollo missions I hadn't heard before - I really went very deep into the mission logs and dug out stuff that I hadn't heard of before.
""The public relations feed for the Apollo 8 lunar orbit was one of my favourite pieces of audio for the whole album.""
One of the tracks on the new album - The Race for Space - is dedicated to cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. However, in a strange twist the music ended up evoking an American theme.
Willgoose said: ""I'd had this guitar riff lying around for a couple of years as I'd tried to use it on another song and it hadn't worked, and it was always at the back of my mind because I really liked it.
""Then when it came to matching up musical ideas that I'd had with likely topics for the album, and having watched the footage of Gagarin's reception on returning to Earth, it seemed to make sense to me in quite an attractively odd and incongruous way.
""It seemed like a strange song to write about him, and a very non-literal one, which appealed to me.
""We treat the source material in different ways on different songs across the album but I loved the idea of making him a pseudo-70s cop show soundtrack and trying to capture some of the exuberance and euphoria I saw on film.
""The original riff ended up being almost totally re-written in the process, and then the brass came on board, so it moved on quite a lot from the original germ of an idea.""
PSB first worked with BFI on 2012's five-track EP The War Room. The record was based on a series of old propaganda films and archive material.
The EP was dedicated to a great uncle of Willgoose who died at Dunkirk in May 1940. The musician still plays the 26 year old World War Two soldier's banjolele.
Willgoose does not rule out working BFI again.
He said: ""We've had such a great experience working with them, and they've been so accommodating and supportive, that I'd like to say yes - but it kind of depends on them.
""I think they're happy with what we've done with their material so I hope we can work on the next release together.""
PSB had hoped to work on their new album in a space of the terrestrial wide open variety.
Following gigs on Mull, Skye, Lewis and Ullapool's Loopallu festival, Willgoose had an idea to ""escape into the wilds"".
""I've been to Loopallu festival a couple of times now,"" he said.
""I think Ullapool is one of the most beautiful places I know, let alone in the UK. It feels like such an escape from London.
""I'd love to spend more time up there and actually try and let the landscape get into the music a bit more.
""I had loads of grand plans for going off into the wilds to write the second album, but we were under such time pressure in and amongst our international touring that I ended up doing it from a south-east London garage instead.
""Maybe next time,"" he added.","The new album from Public Service Broadcasting recalls the triumphs and tragedies of early space exploration through samples from films and recordings of Nasa and USSR rocket launches, many previously unavailable to the public."

Figures from the NI Cancer Registry reveal there is a higher diagnosis rate among young people in Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK.
Five charities have come together to provide a new service that includes five new nursing posts, one in each health trust.
There are also social workers and community workers to guide young people at home, school and work.
The service aims to ensure young people have equal clinical and psychological support for their medical and social needs no matter where they live.
Figures also reveal that the amount of miles that local families, seeking support, clock up is the second highest compared to their counterparts elsewhere.
Up until now, the service has been confined to the Belfast Cancer Centre and The Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children.
Bridging that gap means the service will now be available in four hospitals including Belfast, Craigavon, Altnagelvin, Ulster and Antrim Area.
That means fewer families will have to make the average 100 mile round trip to get treatment in Belfast.
Leona McManus, 22, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year.
""Travelling while undergoing treatment is hard. You are tired, sick, often in pain. I had to travel from Limavady to Belfast.

""It is a distinct specialism in the treatment of cancer. The aim of the regional service is to reduce mortality rates and to provide support for patients and their families.""

36948649,"The striker, on loan from Aberdeen, latched onto Scott Fraser's pass for the opener and grabbed his second with a high-class solo run and smart finish.
He dispatched a penalty for his treble by the 30th minute and United could have had several more by half-time.
Sean Welsh's penalty gave Thistle hope but United saw out the win comfortably.
The hosts were sluggish in the first half of their Championship opener against Queen of the South on Saturday but there was nothing to fault the way they started this tie.
United had too much pace and ingenuity for their top-flight opponents,  the outstanding Scott Fraser and Tope Obadeyi causing havoc with their movement.
Obadeyi, twice, and Blair Spittal might have added further goals by the interval but United boss Ray McKinnon manager must have been happy with the three they did score.
Smith showed the benefit of a regular start on loan, taking his goal tally to four for the Terrors, the same number he scored in nearly 90 appearances for Aberdeen, though a high percentage of those outings were as a substitute.
His first was a sublime finish, gathering a delicious Fraser pass, controlling the ball then steering it behind Ryan Scully.
For his second, Smith picked up possession just inside the Thistle half, run away from Callum Booth then held off the defender to score when he got back to him in the box.
The 20-year-old completed his hat trick with a penalty struck straight down the middle after Ziggy Gordon blocked Blair Spittal's shot with an arm.
Thistle were given a glimpse of a way back from a penalty of their own when Chris Erskine was pushed over by Mark Durnan and Welsh scored with 25 minutes left, but United's defence held firm.
United boss Ray McKinnon: ""We played some very good football in the first half, especially the forward play, and when the penalty was given against us in the second, I was really pleased with how we reacted.  We showed some resilience.
""Some of the link-up play and finishing was pretty special. Cammy's composure and movement for the goals was outstanding, he has done really well since coming in on loan. I am delighted for him.
""There were huge positives all over. Young left-back Jamie Robson was outstanding, Scott Fraser was outstanding, Blair Spittal was excellent and Tope Obadeyi playing as a lone striker was fantastic.""
United hat-trick hero Cammy Smith: ""The standard has been set after that. We looked dangerous every time we went forward and could have had a few more goals, but we have to be happy with our night's work.  It is a great victory for us.
""It wasn't like [Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes] was pushing me out the door. We had a few chats and thought going out on loan would be best for my development. I am here to play games and long may it continue.""
Thistle boss Alan Archibald: ""It was awful right from kick-off - a really poor performance.  I didn't see that coming.
""It was the total opposite of the weekend win [2-0] against Caley Thistle when our keeper didn't have a serious save to make. We were unrecognisable and I feel sorry for our fans that have paid good money to travel here.
""We stood off United from the kick off, made poor decisions right across the pitch and guys who are usually our leaders didn't do it tonight. Nobody got pass marks across the board. Everyone including myself has to look themselves in the mirror.""

31852220,"It will consider the deployment of police officers in undercover roles by police forces in England and Wales.
It comes after controversy surrounding the conduct of undercover officers.
Meanwhile, a separate review into the relationship between the Home Office and the SDS says a key file is missing.
The inquiry announced on Thursday will also make recommendations about how undercover policing is conducted and will scrutinise the use of undercover officers by the now-defunct SDS and National Public Order Intelligence Unit.
Among the allegations are that undercover officers took fake identities from dead children, had relationships with campaigners and fathered children.
Mrs May said that the work of barrister Mark Ellison and Operation Herne - an investigation into undercover policing at the Metropolitan Police - has unearthed ""serious historical failings"" in undercover policing practices.
Mr Ellison - who in 2012 successfully prosecuted Gary Dobson and David Norris for the murder of teenager Stephen Lawrence - has been examining police corruption during the original investigation into the killing in 1993.
She added: ""As I said last year, I was profoundly shocked by Mark Ellison's findings and committed to establishing a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the SDS.
""While I initially said that Mark Ellison's further work and criminal investigations needed to conclude before the inquiry commences, it has become apparent that these pieces of work were much larger than initially envisaged.
""In the interest of learning the lessons of past failures, I have decided to establish the inquiry now while ensuring existing work is not affected.
""Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future.""
This latest inquiry will be led by judge Lord Justice Pitchford.
Mrs May had announced her intention to set up a judge-led public inquiry following the report of the independent Ellison Inquiry in March last year.
That had found Scotland Yard spied on Stephen Lawrence's family.
And Operation Herne found that the SDS had carried out undercover operations to gather information on 18 justice campaigns over 35 years.
This included the campaign regarding Jean Charles de Menezes, shot by police after being mistaken for a terrorist in the days following the London Underground bombings in 2005.
The SDS was set up in 1968 to infiltrate pressure groups and remained operational until 2008.
It has been the focus of controversy over claims that some undercover officers had sexual relationships and fathered children with campaigners, to help build trust in their false identities.
Chief Constable Mick Creedon of the Association of Chief Police Officers said: ""Undercover policing is a vital police tactic has saved lives, protected victims and brought dangerous criminals to justice.""
He also said that the public inquiry would help make sure that the ""unacceptable behaviour of some officers in the past never happens again"".
""Changes have already been made to the authorisation and management of these operations.
""New training and guidance for undercover officers guidance developed with the College of Policing reinforces the need for them to meet the highest ethical standards.""
The allegations about the SDS include that its officers worked to discover information about the Lawrence family, which could be used to smear them following Stephen Lawrence's death.
His father, Neville, said he would like to be fully involved in the inquiry.
He added: ""I've always felt that my family were under greater investigation than those guilty of killing my beloved Stephen and so it is only natural to want to discover what was really going on.""
Jules Carey, of Bindmans solicitors, which represents the woman known as ""Jacqui"" who had a child with an undercover officer, said: ""For the inquiry to fulfil its purpose of restoring public confidence it will be vital to ensure that there is proper consultation with all interested parties in the framing of the terms of reference for the inquiry.""
She also said that the inquiry must be ""conducted in an open manner that allows those affected by spying to question the undercover officers and those who responsible for their deployment"".
Meanwhile, Mrs May has also published an independent review of the Home Office's knowledge of SDS activities, commissioned in March last year and conducted by Stephen Taylor, former director at the Audit Commission.
Mr Taylor said it was not possible to say if a missing file regarding SDS, which would have included documents classified as ""secret"" and ""top secret"", was due to ""human error or deliberate concealment"".
Mr Taylor also said that ""given the absence of documents and the passage of time"" he could not rule out the possibility that ""an individual or individuals within the Home Office"" may have been aware of:",An inquiry into undercover policing and the operation of the Metropolitan Police's Special Demonstration Squad is being established by Home Secretary Theresa May.

Spectre and Skyfall took a total of five years to make, he told BBC Radio's Test Match Special.
""It feels almost, even though we've just finished shooting it, like one big experience and it was a fantastic life-changing thing,"" he said. But he added he did not think he could go through it again.

Mendes made his name in theatre, and directed a new stage production of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in between making the Bond films.
But shooting a Bond movie is ""pretty much all encompassing"", he explained.
""I'm happiest rehearsing a play or editing a movie, and when I've finished editing a movie I generally want to be back in a theatre environment again,"" he said.
""It feels like home, it feels controllable after the chaos of a movie set. But it won't be long before I want to do another film, and I'm very fortunate to be able to go back and forth between the two.""
Spectre has been filmed in locations including London, Mexico, Italy and Morocco, and the cast and crew totalled more than 1,000 people, Mendes revealed.
""And you really do feel it,"" he said. ""This is a bigger movie than Skyfall. It's shot in more places - we were in Mexico City and Tangiers and northern Sahara and Rome and the Alps and London. It's been an enormous undertaking.""
Spectre also stars Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Andrew Scott, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
The plot involves ""a cryptic message from Bond's past [that] sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organisation"".
Mendes revealed that the Spectre theme song was finished - but would not disclose who had recorded it. ""I can say that the song's been recorded and it's fantastic and I'm very excited about it,"" he said. ""You won't have to wait long.""
Skyfall made Â£700m ($1.1bn) at box offices worldwide.","James Bond director Sam Mendes has said he does not want to make any more 007 films after the next instalment, which comes out in October."
35546399,"A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth.
The proposal to allow abortion in such cases was defeated by 59 votes to 40.
The result followed a passionate debate at Stormont after some MLAs proposed the law change be introduced by way of an amendment to the Justice Bill.
Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland.
Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health.
Politicians have been lobbied to reform the law since 2013, when Northern Ireland woman Sarah Ewart spoke out about having to travel to Great Britain for an abortion after she was told she was carrying a baby that had no chance of survival.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) faced criticism from other parties during Wednesday's debate for asking the Health Minister Simon Hamilton to set up a working group to examine the issues raised by fatal foetal abnormality.
It could take six months for the group to complete its work and the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt claimed it was a DUP ""device"" to delay decision making on abortion reform until after May's assembly election.
Justice Minister David Ford, who brought forward the proposed change to the legislation, told Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show it could now remain in limbo for some time.
""It would appear that that is what some people want, that it was any excuse at all to avoid taking a decision last night so they can fudge the issue,"" he said.
""We will wait and see what happens to the DUP's supposed working group for the next six months. Certainly, we'll get the DUP past the election, maybe that's why they're doing it.""
However, the DUP has argued that the issue required proper consideration by MLAs and ministers and that the Justice Bill was not intended for this purpose.
The amendment to legalise abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality was proposed by Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson.
He told MLAs: ""If we are to continue to fail women in Northern Ireland in this area then we are abdicating our duties as representatives.
""The traumatic journey to England for many young women is becoming a shame on Northern Ireland and to force women with a fatal foetal pregnancy to look elsewhere for help and support make this worse.""
The amendment relating to pregnancies which are the result of rape or incest was put forward by Anna Lo, also of the Alliance Party, and was defeated by by 64 votes to 30.
Mr Nesbitt said that as a man he did not feel comfortable ""discussing what a woman should do with her body"" but he added that MLAs had a responsibility to legislate.
He claimed the DUP's request for a commission was a delaying tactic designed to ""kick the decision to the far side of the election"".
Mr Nesbitt described the delay as ""cruel"" and ""Dickensian"".
""This is Bleak House we're in today, in the Chancery courts waiting day after day, after day, after day for a decision that never comes,"" he said.
Sinn Féin MLA Caitríona Ruane also criticised the DUP for ""supporting a commission which will report in six months"".
""What about the plight of women in the here and now? What about the women who are pregnant as the result of rape, or women who are faced with fatal foetal abnormalities?
""Is the DUP going to tell them 'we're having a commission in six months and sure, then we'll see where is goes?'  I'm sorry, long-fingering this does a disservice to women,"" Ms Ruane said.
However, Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MLAs expressed doubt that doctors could accurately predict that an unborn child had no chance of survival.
SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said clinicians had told her party that ""there is no such definition"" as fatal foetal abnormality.
Speaking independently from her party, Alliance MLA Anna Lo proposed that women who have become pregnant as a result of sexual crime should have access to a legal abortion in Northern Ireland.
Ms Lo said that forcing pregnant rape victims to give birth meant they would be ""reminded every day of that act of violence which was forced upon her"".
However, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister described Ms Lo's amendment as a  ""charter for abortion on demand"".
He said that because of his background as a barrister he had more experience than most MLAs of rape trials and added that ""95% of the time, the question for the jury is - was the sexual intercourse consensual or not?""
""All you have to do is to allege indecent assault it seems, rape, and you're entitled on the nod of a medical practitioner to abortion,"" he said.
Mr Allister told MLAs that allegations of rape could only be proven through ""due process"" and this was not possible within the timeframe of pregnancy.
DUP MLA Emma Pengelly spoke in support of the working group on fatal foetal abnormality.
""I have not had the beautiful privilege to have brought a child into this world but I can empathise with all my heart that the wished for, the longed for, can turn so quickly to tragedy,"" she said.
""The way forward that we are proposing is a compassionate one, it is a sensible one, it is a common sense one that will leave all of us in a much better and informed position to chart a loving and kind way forward.""
At the end of the debate, Assembly Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin commended MLAs on the ""sense of dignity"" they displayed during the discussions.
Stormont's chief legal adviser, Attorney General John Larkin QC, is among those who are opposed to changing the law and has outlined concerns that the move could breach obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).
Precious Life, one of the largest pro life organisations in the region vowed to ""expose"" any MLA who voted in favour of the new legislation.
Amnesty International said failing to reform the law would be a ""betrayal of women"", while the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission urged political action.",Northern Ireland Assembly members have voted against legalising abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.

South Lakeland District Council said up to 1,000 properties could be at risk and that military personnel could be deployed to install temporary flood defences to protect vital infrastructure.
The worst of the weather is expected from Saturday evening through to Sunday.
In some places, a month's worth of rain has been forecast to fall in 24 hours.
Falling on already saturated ground, it is likely to cause localised surface water flooding and high river levels, the Environment Agency said.
The Met Office has also warned of possible flooding in parts of Scotland in the wake of Storm Abigail.
Nicola Willis, from the Met Office, said high ground was likely to be most affected by heavy rain.
""These areas have had a lot of rain already this week and they are already quite saturated,"" she said.
""We are expecting the rain to be heavy and persistent, although the heaviest rain will not necessarily continue through the whole of the warning period.""
Cumbria was hit by severe floods in November 2009.
During those incidents, Pc Bill Barker, 44, died after the bridge he was standing on collapsed in Workington, a town about 13 miles north of Egremont.
Craig Woolhouse, from the Environment Agency, said it was working closely with emergency services to prepare for any problems.
He added: ""Our teams are already in action clearing watercourses, maintaining existing defences and standing ready to deploy temporary pumps and defences where these can be effective.""
The latest band of rain comes in the wake of Storm Abigail, which closed schools and brought down power lines in parts of Scotland.
The Christmas lights switch-on in Bradford on Saturday was cancelled because of the weather forecast.","Twelve severe flood warnings have been issued for Cumbria and Lancashire, warning people to take immediate action and prepare for flooding."

The man was treated in hospital for a head injury and released. He was re-admitted at a later date and told he needed surgery for a fractured skull.
The incident was reported to police on 3 March. They want to trace the two men who found the man and other witnesses.
Det Con Stephen Palmer said: ""A man has been left with a very serious head injury as a result of this attack and inquiries are at an early stage to establish what happened.

Craig Benson finished second, with Commonwealth champion and pre-race favourite Ross Murdoch third in Glasgow.
London 2012 silver medallist Michael Jamieson was fifth in what could be the final race of his career.
""This means so much. It's such a great field,"" Willis, 25, told BBC Sport.
He is the fifth swimmer to manage a Rio 2016 qualification time, following Adam Peaty, Hannah Miley, James Guy and Max Litchfield.
Willis, who won in two minutes 8.08 seconds - inside the qualifying time of 2:08.52 - reached the London 2012 final and finished third behind Murdoch and Jamieson at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

""I know if I get that place that I can go quicker, as I've done it in the past,"" she said.
""I was fourth at the last Olympics, so perhaps it'll be a case of third time lucky.""
Freestyle specialist Guy followed up his 400m gold and Olympic place from Tuesday with victory in the 100m butterfly.
He won in 52.15 secs, which, although outside the qualifying time of 51.24, he hopes will earn him a spot in the men's 4x100m medley relay team for Rio.
""Last year we were fourth [at the World Championships] and we hope that with the right mix we can potentially win a medal in Rio,"" Guy told BBC Radio 5 live.

Many analysts think Sony's kit will outsell rival headsets from HTC and Facebook's Oculus division because of its lower price and the fact that more than 43 million PS4 consoles have been shipped.
Even so, they add, it is likely to remain a niche product for some time to come.

39445724,"Russell Sherwood, 69, of Cilfrew, Neath, went missing while heading to Ewenny, Vale of Glamorgan, after Storm Angus hit in November.
Three days later, his body was found in the River Ogmore.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is reviewing issues, including the force's call-handling.
Mr Sherwood was reported missing on 20 November after failing to collect his wife from work.
He was found dead on 23 November inside his Ford Focus, which had become submerged in the river.
The IPCC said it would investigate the police response to an earlier report of flooding across New Inn Road in Ewenny on the day of Mr Sherwood's disappearance.
It will also consider ""whether call-handlers properly risk-assessed the information provided to them"", but not Mr Sherwood's death specifically.
IPCC Commissioner for Wales Jan Williams said: ""My thoughts are with the family of Mr Sherwood and all those affected by his tragic death.
""Our investigation will examine police actions prior to his disappearance and whether appropriate policies and procedures were followed.
""We have made contact with Mr Sherwood's family to explain our role and we will be keeping them updated as the investigation progresses.""",An investigation has been launched into South Wales Police's response to reported flooding before the death of a missing man.
38736729,"Some reported death threats, with more than half of those questioned saying they had had physical threats.
More than a third of the UK's 195 female MPs took part in the research.
Of these, two thirds said they felt ""less safe"" following the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox last summer.
Deputy Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said Parliament was working with police to ensure MPs' safety and offer training to enhance their security while away from Westminster.
The anonymous 5 Live survey, conducted last month, saw one respondent remarking that ""the level of violence and abuse has significantly increased in the last years. At times I have been very frightened.""
Another wrote: ""Had to phone the police once, [after] a constituent threatened to kill me.""
Following the murder of Mrs Cox, who represented Batley and Spen, one MP said she had received ""absolutely zero"" support from Parliament or her party.
Another wrote: ""I asked my kids' view on whether I should stop after Jo's death, but their support was all I needed. Standing up to bullies is the only answer.""
""I won't give in,"" wrote another.
The research reveals how abuse faced by politicians can affect their families. One MP wrote: ""The feeling of not being able to protect my children was unexpected, as was having panic buttons fitted.""
One revealed she had ""worries for the safety of my parents in the constituency"", while another found she was ""more protective of my family and info on where they live/go to school"".
In the wide-ranging survey, female politicians were asked for their views on getting more women into Parliament.
More than half were in favour of all-female shortlists, while almost half wanted a crackdown on ""unprofessional or sexist"" language at Westminster.
But the idea of allowing breastfeeding in the chamber was resoundingly rejected. One MP said: ""I wouldn't breastfeed my baby if I worked on the checkout at Tesco, so why would I do it in the chamber?""
Two-thirds of those who responded to the survey said getting more women elected would mean Parliament would make better decisions.
One commented that ""less time would be wasted. Too much hot air from men"". Another said: ""Parliament might be run more sensibly - less time wasted on posturing and debate for the sake of debate.""
Almost two-thirds of the female MPs who responded to the survey said they had received sexist comments from fellow workers or MPs  - with one told she should be ""in the kitchen washing the dishes"".
One woman MP said she had experienced sexual assault and two said they had been groped.
Of the women with children who responded, the majority found long-distance travel, irregular hours and late parliamentary sittings a problem.
One mother commented that ""constant 'dissing' and lack of valuing what an MP does, children pick this up"".
Another worried about the ""embarrassment of my kids if I do anything controversial"" and a ""risk of bullying"".
The women MPs were asked whether they would still stand for Parliament if they were just starting out, knowing what they do now. One in six said they would not, but the majority said they would.
One wrote that ""having put so much into becoming [an MP], you can feel like a slot-machine addict - it's hard  to walk away"".  Another said: ""The good I can do is 100% worth the flak I get.""
One respondent commented: ""Of course - don't let the buggers win.""
Mr Hoyle said: ""Members of Parliament, and their staff and families, are facing unprecedented levels of attacks, abuse and threats. No one should have to endure this as 'part of a job'.""
The Parliamentary Security Department worked with the Metropolitan Police to ensure security while MPs were at Westminster, he added.
Mr Hoyle also said: ""Since September 2016 the House of Commons has appointed a contractor to support all members, who wish it, to install security measures recommended for all MPs by the National Police Chiefs' Council.
""The Parliamentary Security Department also offers members personal security advice, based on best-practice guidance from police and security experts, and is currently working with the Suzy Lamplugh Trust to provide self-protection and personal security training to MPs and their staff.""","An overwhelming majority of women MPs have received online and verbal abuse from the public and a third have considered quitting as a result, a BBC Radio 5 live survey suggests."

33735160,"But does the fate of Greece matter to the wider world? Does it matter if Greece eventually leaves the eurozone, or even the European Union?
The short answer is yes. Most people care about the fate of Greece, and hope that it can maintain stability and feel secure.
Many people, but by no means all, believe that its membership of ""Club Europe"" is one guarantee of a stability which has so often been denied to Greece in the past.
For at least the past hundred years, Greece has swung between democracy and dictatorship, between civilian and military rule, and the outside world would like to be sure the pendulum now stays firmly in the position marked ""democratic, civilian government"".
Both history and geography help explain why Greece matters far beyond its borders.
The society which gave the world the embryo of modern democracy in Ancient Greece has only enjoyed 40 years of continuous parliamentary democracy in modern times. The days of the ""Greek colonels"" are still in the not-very-distant past. The last military regime in Athens was overthrown in 1974.
Thirty years earlier, in 1944, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, as uncomfortable wartime allies against the Nazis, were carving up the Balkans between East and West for the post-war era. In Moscow, Churchill put it to Stalin: ""Let us settle about our affairs in the Balkans.""
Britain's wartime leader wrote down his proposals in pencil on a sheet of paper:
A couple of later additions and amendments in red ink are important.
The Greece section is changed so that ""the others 10%"" becomes ""Russia 10%"".
And after Great Britain's claim to 90% influence has been added the words ""in accord with USA"", recognising where the real post-war power would lie.
It was part of the far larger, so-called ""percentages agreement"" attempting to parcel out Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Hungary too. There's a blue pencil tick near the top of the page, apparently in Stalin's hand.
He may have honoured that limit to his influence in Greece, but certainly not his apparent agreement to share Hungary and Bulgaria.
After that, Churchill moved very swiftly to try to ensure that the Greek Communists - who had been such a strong force in the divided Resistance to Nazi occupation - would not prevail.
He made a dangerous flight to Athens on Christmas Day, 1944, and on 26 December posed with the Greek Orthodox Archbishop Damaskinos of Athens.
Churchill backed him as regent, or temporary head of state, ahead of Greece's descent into the nightmare of civil war between communists and anti-communists.
That civil war is called by some the first battle of the Cold War.
If you accept that another contest for influence between Vladimir Putin's Russia and the West is now under way, it's not hard to see why anything like ""Grexit"", which would detach Greece from the inner core of EU states, alarms not just fellow European leaders, but also the United States.
President Putin has been courting the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras. It's true that the Russian leader has offered only limited financial support.
But some experts see real opportunities for Russia either way: if the Greek marriage to the EU were to end in a messy divorce or if Greece stays in but continues to hedge its bets through friendship with Moscow.
The most imaginative commentators even suggest that if Greece left the EU it would then be bankrolled by Moscow in exchange for Greek agreement to resign from Nato as well, allowing Russian warships to sail unhindered through Greek waters into the Mediterranean.
Even if that seems far-fetched, there's little doubt Mr Putin would see himself as the winner if Greece became either semi-detached or wholly detached from the European Union and perhaps permanently destabilised. Anything which hurts the European Union can look like an advance seen from the Kremlin.
A brief look at an atlas reminds us why Churchill wanted to be sure of Greece.
Greek territory controls a huge area at the north-eastern corner of the Mediterranean. Its territory includes several hundred islands in the Aegean, Ionian and Mediterranean Seas.
Greece forms the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula.
It is the cornerstone of south-eastern Europe, even if Cyprus is now the furthest outpost of the EU in that direction.
It didn't take very long after the restoration of democracy to Greece in 1974 for the country to be welcomed into the European Union in 1981.
That was meant to be a decisive turning point, cementing Greece into political and social stability.
When the question of Greece joining was debated in the House of Commons in 1979, one of the senior Foreign Office ministers in Margaret Thatcher's first government, the Lord Privy Seal, Sir Ian Gilmour, spoke approvingly of: ""...the political significance of accession, the endorsement which it represents of Greece's democratic progress and of her decisive orientation towards Western Europe. But economically, too, accession will be of great importance to Greece. It will be a challenge and an opportunity.""
Greece's membership has certainly proved to be a challenge as well as an opportunity.

32229796,"Two days later Hyundai Trajet Y264 TKP is shunted into a Cornish garage, and declared by the owner George to be ""finished"".
Or in the words of the recycling industry, it has become an end-of-life vehicle.
Here rusty hulks lie forlornly in a line waiting for scrap - after hundreds of thousands of miles of family holidays, car-sick children, back-seat driving, wasp-rich picnics and school runs.
Remembering the car was 12 years old, I chirpily mention that a £150 cheque from a scrap merchant would come in handy.
""£150? Lucky to get £50,"" says George.
George sits in his office outside the tiny Cornish village of Doublebois and patiently explains the macroeconomic forces at play that have reduced my car to a hunk of worthless metal.
China, he reckons, is the problem. With Chinese demand falling, the price of iron ore is on the way down and scrap metal prices are following in their wake.
A year ago George could have got £160 for my car.  During the Beijing Olympics prices skyrocketed.
Not now. ""There's a worldwide glut of metal,"" he explains.
And Y264 TKP is 75% metal, albeit dented and scratched by bike racks, my mother's gate post and, for reasons too complex to go into, the teeth of a small pony.
There are other problems too - the collapse in demand, unsurprisingly, from Ukraine, and the eurozone recession.
One insider put it bluntly: ""The business is bloody painful"".
Charles Ambrose of the UK's Motor Vehicle Dismantlers' Association (MVDA) said: ""In the last few years we've lost 30 members or so going out of business. Most of them are long term players. They are being kicked from all sides.""
George will bear away poor crippled Y264 TKP to be eviscerated in an ""authorised treatment facility"". It will be ""de-polluted"", the battery, and tyres removed, the diesel, oils, and brake fluids sucked out.
The oils will be re-refined or used as fuel. The battery will be ground down, the acid neutralised, the polymers separated from the lead, to go towards making a new one.
Of course, I could bypass George altogether and get a little more - cash in hand - from someone, er, less respectable.
The MVDA believes 600,000 of the 1.7 million cars scrapped every year simply fall off the official radar, unregistered, untaxed. The paper trail vanishes into a black hole, or rather a black market.
Environmental niceties are not observed on the black market.
But the expense of putting anything in a landfill in the UK and the difficulty of dumping cars means even the vanished ones work their way back into the recycling system.
""It's hard to know exactly where those cars go,"" says Mr Ambrose. ""We know a tremendous number are broken up and the parts end up on eBay.
""Others are exported as whole cars or as spare parts. Parts of your car could end up in a vehicle in Nigeria. That's not a problem environmentally. It's still recycling.
""But the money involved in this kind of black market is often also involved in crime.""
So one way or another almost 95% of Y264 TKP will be recycled. The UK is expected to hit the 95% car recycling target set by the European Union's end-of-life vehicle directive this year or next.
Which is why the plastic bits of Y264 TKP, like the cup-holders stuffed with my daughters' hair-ties, will not go to landfill.
The legislation has forced industry to come up with recycling solutions - at a cost.
Ian Hetherington, director general of the British Metals Recycling Association says: ""The capital expenditure to develop this kind of technology is very high indeed, and it is only profitable when you are producing very high quality plastics at the end of it.""
So the American firm MBA Polymers invested $30m (£20m) to develop technology to recycle high grade plastics.
Its joint venture with the UK's European Metal Recycling (EMR) in Worksop recycles 80,000 tonnes of plastic every year. The plastic pellets are then sold to manufacturers.
The alarming truth is the plastic trim of Y264 TKP, which the dog did such appalling things to on the way home from Scotland in 2008, could end up as part of a Nespresso coffee machine.
But plastic, like metal, is subject to market prices. It is the low oil price this time. Cheap oil makes ""virgin"" plastic cheaper, so while the law insists on recycling, the margins for the recycled stuff are squeezed.
Then there is the fluff - the padding, the upholstery, and probably the shoe my son lost in 2007. Technically it is ASR, or automobile shredder residue. There is a good chance it will go to landfill.
But there is also a chance it may go through another innovation - a new energy-from-waste plant in Oldbury, in the West Midlands where Chinook Sciences and EMR will turn it into electricity to be sold into the grid.
The grubby left over bits of Y264 TKP will then power, say, my washing machine.
Finally there's the metal - the easy bit, even if its value is small.
Y264 TKP, replete with my memories, will go into a crusher, something like the Red Giant made by the New York firm Hammel, or perhaps even the monstrous Hammel 1500DK  that will devour a car body in around 20 seconds.
The parts are then separated, using magnets and flotation tanks to divide materials according to their atomic weights.
This is the law of the scrap dealer: Separation creates value.
There are precious metals to be had: rhodium, palladium and platinum, and rare earth metals, once discarded, now picked clean from mirrors, batteries and catalytic converters.
Some call it ""Urban Mining"".
One recycling expert described it thus: ""The iron ore miners take the stuff from below the ground, we just take it from above the ground.""
The steel will probably go abroad for smelting. Scrap is best suited for electric arc-furnaces rather than blast furnaces, and the most convenient ones are in southern Europe. Turkey is the favoured destination.
From there, the metamorphosed chassis of Y264 TKP, possibly still tainted with the last few grains of sand from a Norfolk beach holiday, is likely to end up as a small (but I like to think important) part of the frame of a middle eastern skyscraper.
Ian Hetherington adds a final suggestion: ""It may though actually go back to South Korea.
""It could even turn into another Hyundai.""","A few miles short of Swindon my car, laden with four teenagers, my wife, one teenager's boyfriend, a dog, and attendant baggage comes to a sudden and it turns out, permanent, halt."
39124119,"Farc leader Ivan Marquez said the group would start by making an inventory of its weapons before handing them over to United Nations monitors.
He said it was a sign of the Farc's ""unconditional commitment to peace"" after more than 50 years of conflict.
The government has yet to reach a peace deal with the ELN rebel group.
The Farc said its fighters would register their weapons with UN monitors and reveal the location of any stashed explosives.
Almost 7,000 rebels are now gathered in 26 transition zones where they are being registered and offered help to reintegrate into civilian life.

""The criminal investigation against them has been halted. No evidence was found,"" police said.
""We now believe that there was never any real danger.""
All 151 passengers were evacuated from the Airbus 319 aircraft using emergency slides, and nine received medical treatment.
The men, aged 31, 38 and 48, were returning to Stansted, in Essex, from Ljubljana on 10 June when the disruption arose. They are said to have been on a business trip.
According to prosecutors, the flight was diverted when fellow passengers reported the men were discussing ""terrorist matters"" and carrying a book entitled ""Kill"" with a sniper rifle on the cover.
They said the contents of the alleged conversation could not be verified.
No explosives were found in the passengers' luggage or on the plane. A backpack belonging to the men was nonetheless blown up by police.
The German tabloid newspaper Bild said passengers told airline staff they had heard the men using the words ""bomb"" and ""explosive"", and said one was carrying a suspicious rucksack.
A spokesman for Cologne-Bonn airport said: ""The pilot had been informed about a suspicious conversation on board, after which he decided to make an unscheduled landing in Cologne-Bonn.
""After the safe landing... the 151 passengers left the [aircraft] via emergency slides and were taken to a transit gate.""
The diverted plane landed in Stansted airport on Sunday.
Passenger Daniel Noonan told the BBC that armed police entered the aircraft and escorted two men off. The third was led away on the tarmac after the passengers had exited via the slides.
Passenger Richard Peters said he saw the two Asian men being handcuffed on the tarmac at Cologne-Bonn airport.
He added that people on the flight were quarantined for about nine hours while police interviewed passengers about the men.
He said: ""To be fair spirits were quite high considering what had happened.
""In the current climate you have to take everything seriously. My suspicion is it was, hopefully, nothing sinister. But you have to take everything seriously.

Another passenger, Dave Hargreaves, said: ""In the flight I didn't see the suspects at all. But I noticed quite a bit of activity, with aircrew popping into the cockpit repeatedly. And a slower than normal serving of the food and drink service.
""Then at our cruising altitude I was surprised to see the air brakes go up on the wings and us start a rather speedy descent. It wasn't until perhaps 10 minutes later that we were told 'due to operational reasons' we would be diverting to Cologne airport.""

34878872,"It said it had introduced the technology to help people get better results when they search.
Often, it said in a blogpost, the best answers to a query were found in an app rather than a web page.
Initially nine apps have been selected to work with the streaming system as it is tested.
Jennifer Lin, Google engineering manager, said the firm started indexing information found in apps two years ago to bolster its larger corpus of search data.
About 40% of searches done via Google now turn up content found in apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb or Pinterest, she said.
Until now, Google has only answered queries with information that is available both on the web and in apps. Now, however, it is starting to show results that are only found in apps.
One example of when these results would show up might be when someone is looking for hotels during a spur-of-the-moment trip to an unfamiliar city, wrote Ms Lin in the blog.
Google said it was using an in-house developed streaming system to give people access to results in apps they do not have installed on their Android handsets.
This lets people try the app and use it as if it were installed, said Ms Lin. An experimental cloud-based virtualisation technology Google has developed underpins the streaming system.
Apps from HotelTonight, Useful Knots, Daily Horoscope and Gormey are among the first to be available via streaming.
Danny Sullivan, founding editor of the Search Engine Land news site, said the streaming system made visible a lot of information that was hard to get at easily.
""It's a bad experience to show links to an app that no-one can view unless they install an app,"" he said.
Plus, he added, it could mean data found in apps was now more widely available and could be put to other uses.
""Potentially, the new system could even cause some apps that might seem to lack linkable content, such as games, to consider app-only links,"" he wrote.
Streamed versions of apps are available via Google's own app and on its Chrome browser. Users must also be on a fast wi-fi connection and be using a handset running Android Lollipop or a more recent version. Lollipop was released in November 2014.
The test of the app streaming and search responses is currently only taking place in the US. Google has not said when, or if, it will be expanded to other parts of the world.",Google has started streaming apps to Android phones so people can use them even if they are not installed on a handset.
38560216,"The President says it's unlikely that power companies will switch back to coal, regardless of Mr Trump's plans to boost production.
Mr Trump has also said he wants the US to pull out of the Paris climate agreement.
But President Obama says this would see the US lose its ""seat at the table"".
The President's views appeared in a policy forum article in the highly regarded research journal, Science.
The editors believe it is the first time that a sitting President has written such a feature.
In the article, the President argues that a ""massive scientific record"" shows that climate change is ""real and cannot be ignored"".
Mr Obama also details the reasons he believes the trend towards a low-carbon economy is now ""irreversible"".
He points to the fact that between 2008 and 2015 the US economy grew by 10% while emissions of CO2 fell by almost the same amount.
Mr Obama says that US businesses have increasingly seen the financial benefits from cutting carbon through greater energy efficiency.
Citing the examples of corporations like General Motors and Alcoa, the President says the US consumed 2.5% less energy in 2015 than in 2008 while the economy was now a tenth bigger.
There would be a huge financial penalty if economies don't reduce their emissions, Mr Obama writes.
If CO2 continues to rise then global temperatures could go up by 4 degrees C by the end of this century, and that could cost the world economy 4% of GDP.
In US terms that would equate to the loss of federal revenue of between $340bn and $690bn every year.
Pointedly, Mr Obama says that 2.2 million Americans now work in jobs connected to energy efficiency - double the 1.1 million that work in fossil fuel production and electricity generation.
Thanks to hydraulic fracturing, gas has emerged as a transformative energy source, now accounting for 33% of US electricity production.
Despite Mr Trump's plans to revive the coal industry by cutting red tape, ""it is unlikely that utilities will change course and choose to build coal-fired power plants, which would be more expensive than natural gas plants, regardless of any near-term changes in federal policy.""
Even states that supported Donald Trump in the presidential election had moved heavily to renewables. Iowa generated 32% of their electricity in 2015 from wind, up from 8% in 2008.
On the Paris climate agreement, Mr Obama said this was a ""fundamental shift in the diplomatic landscape which has already yielded substantial dividends"".
Pulling out of the agreement, as Mr Trump has mulled doing, would see the United States lose its seat at the table, and be unable to hold other countries to their commitments, the President wrote. Continued participation in the Paris process, Mr Obama said, would yield great benefit for the American people and the international community.
However, the outgoing president was careful to offer an olive branch of sorts to President-elect Trump. Mr Obama argued that the targets that the US signed up to in the Paris agreement could be achieved in many different ways and ""this does not mean that the next Administration has to follow identical domestic policies"".
Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook","Renewable energy sources will continue to grow in the US despite the antipathy of the incoming Trump administration, says President Obama."
35896175,"Some of the weapons were discovered when officers stopped two vehicles in Ratoath - the same village where a man was shot dead on Wednesday night.
Two assault rifles and ammunition were found in the vehicles and in follow-up searches nearby two pistols, silencers and more ammunition was recovered.
Police said the operation is ongoing.
It involved officers from the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, supported by national police units, including the Emergency Response Unit.
The investigation follows the fatal shooting of Noel Duggan in The Old Mill housing estate in Ratoath at about 19:45 local time on Wednesday.
Mr Duggan was a well-known criminal linked to cigarette smuggling and also had connections to a Dublin family who were caught up in a fatal feud in the city last month.
A police statement said Thursday evening's operation was targeted at ""organised criminal groups involved in the provision and distribution of firearms"".

36844614,"Contractions in the construction and production industries were balanced out by a growth in services.
UK GDP grew by 0.4% over the same period.
Scottish GDP per person - which takes population changes into account - was also flat during the first quarter of 2016.
During the first three months of the year services in Scotland grew by 0.4%, while production contracted by 1.2% and construction by 1.5%.
On an annual basis, Scotland's economy grew by 0.6%, compared with UK growth of 2%.
The figures were compiled by Scotland's chief statistician.
The GDP figures were released on the same day as official data showed that unemployment in Scotland fell by 18,000 between March and May.
A leading economic forecaster described the two sets of figures as ""a mixed bag"" for the Scottish economy.
Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute at the University of Strathclyde, said growth had been ""stagnant""  over the first three months of the year.
""While the all-important services sectors grew, there was a sharp fall in production and construction,"" he said.
""Of greatest concern was the fall in manufacturing, which was down 2.6% over the three months and 5.4% over the year. This was the sharpest fall in annual manufacturing output since the 2008/09 financial crisis.
""On the plus side, revisions to the data paint a rosier picture of growth last year. The Scottish economy is now estimated to have grown in each and every quarter of 2015, with growth of 1.4% in 2015 up from the previous estimate of just +0.9%.
""Despite that, Scotland continued to lag behind the UK as a whole.""
Responding to the GDP figures, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce called for ""a concerted government response to Scotland's growth problems and swift clarification of the position of EU nationals working in the UK"".
Chief executive Liz Cameron said: ""Scotland's growth has now been at a fraction of that of the UK as a whole for a full year and there are few signs of a major improvement in sight.
""In the light of the EU referendum result, the Scottish and UK governments must take all steps necessary to support businesses at this time and help them to invest for the future and get our economy back on the path of growth.""
The Federation of Small Businesses said the growth figures presented a challenge.
Scottish policy convener Andy Willox said: ""These pre-referendum figures demonstrate that the Scottish economy was underperforming before the vote.
""Business surveys and feedback suggest that some investment plans and deals have been put on hold as a consequence of recent economic and political turbulence.
""As Number 10 and Bute House draw up plans to restore business confidence, they must think about community firms as well as the stock market.
""They must shelve proposals that would give business owners headaches and think about local infrastructure as well as large national projects.""
In a report released last week, accountancy firm PwC downgraded its growth forecasts for Scotland's economy.
It suggested house prices were set to fall north of the border amid an economic slowdown - but a recession would be avoided.","There was no growth in the Scottish economy in the first three months of this year, according to official figures."
33669582,"South Central Ambulance Service and South East Coast Ambulance sent out land and air crews to an area near the Discovery Centre at Swinley Forest, Crowthorne at 15:57 BST on Saturday.

35323038,"Darren Ferris, 24, from Motherwell, lost control of his Ford Mondeo which hit 44-year-old Linda Carson in the town's Muirhouse Road on 27 September.
Mrs Carson later died at the scene from multiple injuries.
Ferris admitted causing her death by dangerous driving. He was jailed for nine years and six months.
Jailing Ferris at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Turnbull told him: ""Your behaviour on that evening, when seen in the context of your previous offending, demonstrates you have no sense of the civilised values by which others in our community live their lives.""
Lord Turnbull said Mrs Carson had been a mother and wife ""in the prime of her life"" who, through the random timing of taking her dog for a walk, found herself in the path of a drunk driver travelling at excessive speed.
He said the author of a background report on Ferris could ""detect little by way insight or genuine remorse"" on his part.
""The consequence of your conduct was predictable, but it was also truly tragic for Mrs Carson and her family,"" he said.
A previous hearing at the High Court in Glasgow was told that on the day of the crash Ferris had been drinking Buckfast and was ""pretty drunk"".
At about 20:00, Mrs Carson left her home in Gresham View, Motherwell, to walk the family dog.
Ferris was seen driving the Mondeo at excessive speed, causing some witnesses to remark that he was ""flying past"" and driving ""like an idiot"".
He then lost control on Muirhouse Road, causing the car to mount the pavement, hit Mrs Carson and then smash into a wall.
Afterwards, Ferris got out of the car and spoke to Mrs Carson who was lying on the pavement.
What he said was not heard, but a bystander then saw him put his hands to his head and shout before running from the scene.
One of the people who tried to help Mrs Carson called the mobile number on the dog's collar and spoke to 47-year-old Mr Carson.
He then rushed to the scene with their 11-year-old daughter and both were comforted by locals while a nurse attempted CPR on Mrs Carson until paramedics arrived.
The court was told that Mrs Carson died from multiple injuries.
Ferris was later seen dropping car keys from the window of his flat at Grange Tower, before police arrived and forced entry.
When he saw them he became aggressive, told them to leave and denied that he had been driving.
A breath test carried out on Ferris 90 minutes after the crash gave a reading of 63mcgs. The legal limit is 22mcgs.
Police experts who examined the crash scene concluded that blame for the fatal collision lay with Ferris who drove at an inappropriate speed in a 30mph limit area, under the influence of alcohol and failed to negotiate a right-hand bend.
Speaking after sentencing, Insp Darren Faulds, of Police Scotland, said: ""Ferris, despite having already been banned from the road for a previous conviction, took the decision to get behind the wheel of that vehicle whilst under the influence of alcohol, and in doing so, had absolutely no regard for the safety of any pedestrians or other motorists in his path.
""Following the fatal crash, in an act of cowardice, he fled from the scene and tried to cover his tracks before being traced and arrested.""",A man with two previous drink-driving convictions has been jailed for killing a woman in a crash while he was over the limit and flouting a driving ban.

It certainly worked for Johnson. It was as she was turning 40 that she set up the San Francisco-based product design company, Coupage, with her engineer husband. Business has been booming ever since.
She is not alone, it seems. Many women entrepreneurs are waiting for the right moment, and are starting their businesses in their forties or beyond - as a second or even third career - having bided their time until they are absolutely ready.
Having worked in product design and then in advertising, Raquel Johnson realised that she did not want to return to the corporate world after she had her younger daughter.
It was challenging walking away from the ""sure thing"" of a steady salary, she says, but she also found it liberating. She has found her ""true passion,"" she says.
""Even the stress I feel now is more enjoyable,"" she explains cheerfully. ""It motivates me and pushes me forward.""
Starting small, the business was run from home and was self-funded at first.
""[When you are older] there is more opportunity for some savings to have accumulated,"" points out Johnson. ""You don't have to take out large loans or search for funders right away.""
Having started with a prototype for a device to integrate an iPod into a car, Coupage has grown steadily, bringing ideas to life in the fields of audio, energy, cars and Apple-related products.
""Once you reach your forties you have the confidence to follow your own path,"" says the US-born businesswoman, Karen Scofield, who set up her company when she was 46.
A sense of humour is also important, she adds with a smile. In the early days, she had to run her firm, London-based fashion brand Lucza, single-handedly.
It was all down to her, from technology mishaps and admin dramas to sudden, urgent errands, like dashing out to the shop to buy a copier cartridge. ""Humour was definitely needed on that day,"" she laughs.
All of which is a far cry from her previous career as a television executive in New York, working for a smooth-running corporate machine.
When she moved to London with her husband and started a family, it was time to think again.
But the skills she had learnt in TV - time and people management, organisation, as well as research and analysis - were highly transferable, she says: Some things, however, she is doing very differently from her old workplace.
Her leadership style at Lucza is ""inclusive,"" she says.
""But the main difference is, now you are the boss, the final decision maker, which can be daunting.
""You decide what is best and you must make these decisions with confidence."" It is something she relishes.
So what advice would Karen Scofield give to other entrepreneurs when the going gets tough? ""You have to push yourself forward, set your own deadlines and keep going.""
The hard work and ""long nights"" have been worth it, she says. The Lucza brand has been increasing year-on-year sales and its pieces are worn by high-profile women such as Samantha Cameron, wife of the British Prime Minister.
She loves that her daughters see her doing something ""new and scary,"" and adds, ""I do think it's incredibly important that women support other women, however and whenever possible.""
She praises The Next Women, an organisation which connects women entrepreneurs via networking events and conducts ""pitch events"" to prepare female entrepreneurs for fundraising pitches. Raquel Johnson found Women 2.0, which champions female tech entrepreneurs, an invaluable support
New groups are increasingly popping up such as the fledgling UK-based organisation My Next Day Job, which is collaborating with Prime, the Prince's Initiative for Mature Enterprise.
Whatever the support, however, taking this path more than half way through your working life takes confidence and bravery.
Sarah Weck of Hidden Springs Maple  - a maple syrup farm, retail website and wholesale business - was emboldened by the opportunities she saw in the market. It was too good to miss.
""Having worked in Silicon Valley I saw how retail was changing, but when I was still in my thirties the market would not have been ready for my business,"" she says.
The maple syrup farming business had been in her husband's family for more than 50 years, but it was Weck who, at the age of 42, decided to combine old-style Vermont with high-tech California, and sell their syrup online.
She now runs the whole operation, from bookkeeping and marketing, to payroll and even scooping ice cream at the farm shop. Her hard work has paid off - the company now has 10 employees, and sales are doubling each year.
And how does gender fit in? There are barriers, she concedes.
""As a woman, you have to make people take you seriously. Men are more prevalent in business, and women have to work at changing the image of business to be gender neutral.""
But, she adds, bias can be overcome. ""I've watched people shift attitudes,"" she says.
In the early days she was overcharged for supplies, until she proved she had researched the supply-and-demand economics for that particular season. ""I'm not sure a man would have had to prove himself in the way I did.""
As for her age, Weck sees it as a definite advantage. She draws on skills she learnt in her previous two careers (she was an English teacher and then a technical writer for a software company), such as leadership and attention to detail.
""I know myself and my strengths and limitations so much better than I did in my twenties and thirties.""
Never a better time than in your forties, seems to be the consensus.
As Raquel Johnson of Coupage puts it: ""Being comfortable in my skin has helped me be much more successful now than when I was younger and more unsure of myself. Recognising when the time is right, and seizing the opportunity is absolutely key to success.""","""Timing is everything,"" says entrepreneur Raquel Johnson."
40402184,"DUP leader Arlene Foster said the ""wide-ranging"" pact was ""good for Northern Ireland and the UK"" -  so where will the money be spent?
The heart of the financial package is infrastructure spending - £400m of it over two years.
That is a significant sum given that Northern Ireland's annual infrastructure budget is about £1bn.
The deal specifically mentions the York Street Interchange, a project to ease congestion where three major roads meet in Belfast.
It is expected to cost about £150m, so there should be plenty left over for other major projects.
They could include a planned transport hub in the centre of Belfast and other major roads schemes like the completion of the A5 or A6.
On top of the £400m, there is a further £150m for ultra-fast broadband.
This was a project which was already being scoped by the Department of the Economy before the collapse of Stormont.
It is ultimately about improving the connectivity of rural businesses.
Previous Stormont/Westminster deals have also included infrastructure but they typically involved allowing Stormont to borrow more.
This time it is cold, hard, no-strings-attached cash.
The money for health and education is more modest - given that a figure of £1bn for health alone was being mentioned during the negotiations.
There is a minimum of £250m for health and and we can assume it will get about half the ""immediate pressures"" money, bringing it to a total of £300m.
That will help ease the problems with waiting lists and give the system some breathing space ahead of a major reform programme.
The ""immediate pressures"" money for education (about £50m) will go some way to easing a growing row with head teachers who have said they will not impose any more cuts.
There is also £100m to be spent on deprived communities over five years.
It will be interesting to see what the delivery mechanism for that money will be.
Stormont's Social Investment Fund, which was also designed to help those communities, has been mired in controversy.
Another part of this deal is to give flexibility to a previously agreed £500m fund for investment in shared education and housing projects.
Stormont has struggled to spend this money, in its first year just £3m of a £50m allocation was spent.
So its is possible that the new flexibility will allow all that money to go into general infrastructure spending.",Northern Ireland will receive an extra £1bn over the next two years as part of the deal that will see the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs back Theresa May's minority government in Commons votes.

39425724,"The screens of the Galaxy S8 and bigger S8+ are also larger despite the devices being about the same size as last year's S7 and S7 Edge.
This time, both models feature displays that curve round the phones' sides.
The launch follows Samsung's botched release of the Note 7, which was recalled twice after fires.
The South Korean firm blamed the problem on battery faults and said it had since put in additional safety measures, including X-ray scans of  batteries.
The company has also become mired in a corruption scandal in its home country.
""The Galaxy S8 is arguably the most important launch of the last 10 years for Samsung and every aspect will be under the microscope following the Note 7 recall,"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS tech consultancy.
""The S8 is a unquestionably a strong product but Samsung must now deliver a faultless launch to move on from its earlier difficulties. If this happens it will emerge in an even stronger position.""
The new devices will be released on 21 April.
The S8 is priced at £690 and the S8+ at £780 - a jump on last year's entry prices of £569 for the S7 and £639 for the S7 Edge.
Samsung was the bestselling handset manufacturer for 2016 as a whole, according to market research firm IDC.
However, Apple overtook it in the final three months.
Source: IDC
The displays of the S8 and S8+, measuring 5.8in (14.7cm) and 6.2in (15.7cm) respectively, mean a more stretched aspect ratio than before, pushing the screens closer to the top and bottom of the handsets.
As a consequence, Samsung's logo no longer features on the front, and the physical home button is replaced with an on-screen icon - in a similar manner to rival Android phones from Huawei and LG.
A pressure sensor and vibration module have, however, been built into the space behind the new virtual button to provide feedback.
Samsung suggests the displays' 18.5:9 ratio makes them better suited to running two apps side by side. For example, there is now space to watch a video, use a chat app and still have room for a full touch-keyboard.
The screens are the same resolution as before but are now brighter, supporting high dynamic range (HDR) playback of videos for extra clarity.
The S8's body is a little narrower than that of the S7, while the S8+'s is a bit wider than the S7 Edge but lighter - Samsung says both new devices can still be used one-handed.
The phones also introduce Bixby - a virtual assistant based on technology acquired from some of the original developers' of Apple's Siri.
The helper is activated by a dedicated side-button and allows 10 built-in apps - including a photo gallery, messages and weather - to be controlled by voice.
It is ""context-aware"", meaning users can ask follow-up questions and assume it is aware of what is currently displayed.
Samsung said it expected owners to mix together voice commands and physical controls - for example asking to see all the photos taken today, then tapping the ones they want, before verbally requesting they be messaged to a friend.
The software can also be used to recognise objects seen via the phone's camera. This can be used to identify a landmark, for example, or tell the owner how much a product would cost to buy online.
Bixby works with Google Play Music, and Samsung intends to open it up to other third-party apps in the future but has not said when.
At launch, it is only designed to recognise US and Korean voices.
""If what Samsung demoed works well in practice, Bixby will be interesting because it offers features absent from Siri and Google Assistant,"" commented Francisco Jeronimo from IDC.
""The race is on to have the best digital assistant, since that will drive hardware sales.
""But in the past, some of Samsung's features have looked great in presentations, but when you use them on a daily basis they have not been as good.""
While Bixby offers new ways to control a phone, it lacks Google Assistant's pre-emptive smarts - it does not interject in chats to suggest places to visit, for example.
However, the search giant's rival artificial intelligence can still be summoned via the home button.
Other improvements over last year's models include:
Samsung also has a range of accessories including a revamped virtual reality headset that is now accompanied by its own motion-sensing controller, and a second-generation 360-degree camera capable of more detailed images than before.
It also offers a new dock that connects the phones to a monitor, keyboard and wireless mouse, allowing them to act as a kind of Android-powered PC.
""Although Microsoft has done this in the past, the performance of the S8 makes it a very compelling experience,"" commented Mr Wood.
""But while I'm impressed with the dock from a technology perspective, the practicality of it for consumers is questionable.""
I'm not sure I share Samsung's bold declaration that the S8 is ""a work of art"" - but the slimmer handset definitely sits more easily in one hand than its predecessor.
And once you see the surface, which is nearly all-screen, you wonder why you ever needed a physical home button or any other furniture around it.
The tech giant has high hopes for its digital assistant Bixby. What I tried was a limited demo model, which only seemed to understand a few predetermined cues such as searching photos and telling you the weather.
The idea of using the camera as Bixby's ""eyes"" is neat - but is it enough to draw people away from the more familiar Google Assistant, which will also be preinstalled, as it is on other Android devices?
I'd like to be able to tell you more about the battery life of what I imagine is a power-hungry little device - but Samsung was coy about that. Batteries are still a sensitive subject.
Samsung Electronics's stock has shrugged off months of bad news, thanks in part to the popularity of last year's Galaxy S7, strong sales of its OLED screens and other components to rival manufacturers, and the fact that investors hope the firm has learned from its mistakes.
Even so, the company will hope its latest launch will demonstrate it has turned a corner.

""It's disappointing obviously, but I think the direction that the club needs to go, it's a rebuild in structure,"" Ruddy told BBC Radio Norfolk.
""For reasons other than football, it was a decision that was made.""
Ruddy, whose final match for the club was their 4-0 win over QPR, continued: ""The club did have the option on me, but mitigating circumstances within that contract meant that it was probably impossible for the club to uphold that.

""Going back to when I was first here, Paul Lambert took what was a calculated risk, I'd say, of £250,000.
""You look back on that now, it's not an awful lot of money. I'm not sure you get too much goalkeeper for £250,000 these days,"" said Ruddy.
""I was grateful to him, to (majority shareholder) Delia Smith and (former chief executive) David McNally for allowing me to join the club, for the years after that, apart from this season and last season, have been superb.
""Four of the seven years here have been in the Premier League. It's been a special time in my life. I'm only 30 years old, I'm not retiring tomorrow.
""We move onto a new day, a new challenge and hopefully I've got 10 years left in me.""","Norwich City goalkeeper John Ruddy was ""not massively"" surprised about being released by the Championship club this summer after seven years."

I was among the last to leave that summit and delegates were in tears. The glass roof of the conference centre was dark with snow.
But since then, a remarkable set of changes has allowed the Paris Agreement to take shape.
Paris climate deal enters force as focus shifts to action
UN review says carbon plans fall well short of climate goals
For a start, the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and US, jointly decided to make a serious push.
For President Obama, this has always been a priority. And for China the new middle class is demanding an end to the toxic pollution smothering the biggest cities.
And that's spurred another shift: renewable energy is falling in price.
Out in the deserts of western China, along the ancient Silk Road, I've seen for myself new forests of wind turbines. Recently, China has planted two of them every hour.
The Chinese push for renewable energy is the largest the world has ever seen. And look at the global figure for solar panels installed last year - it was half a million every day.
A third big change is the involvement of leading companies.
A decade ago, it was rare for me to get a corporate press release making a green boast. Now my inbox is bursting with them.
On Friday, 10 oil companies announced a one-billion-dollar fund for low-carbon technology - something inconceivable not long ago but, let's be clear, the sum is dwarfed by the money spent developing new sources of oil.
So will the Paris Agreement get anywhere? On the one hand, it doesn't oblige any government to cut their greenhouse gases.
But, on the other, each country's efforts will be scrutinised every five years.
And although the agreement has no teeth, it does represent something unique: the first time that every nation on the planet has signed up to try to head off the worst effects of global warming.","Only seven years ago, the very idea that an international climate agreement would come into force today looked hopeless."

""We're coming out here to achieve a medal and hopefully gold,"" she said.
""Sevens is a game anything can happen, anyone can win. You might be up top and five seconds later you're losing.""
On the prospect of facing Brazil in their opening Pool C game, Joyce said: ""We're just going to take it like it's any other team, go out there fighting. It's going to be one of our hardest games.""
Team GB also face Japan on Saturday, before a match against Canada on Sunday with the quarter-finals to follow.
The only non-English member of the squad, Joyce says she has settled in well and is enjoying the experience.
""The facilities here are amazing, we are loving every second of it,"" she said.
""We get free time and chances to play monopoly, cards and we're all loving Mario Kart [a video game].
""It's honestly amazing and one of the best experiences I can ever imagine.""
The Team GB squad have now arrived in the athletes' village in Rio after a training camp in Belo Horizonte.
""I think it's going to be completely different level of excitement in the athletes' village. It will be amazing to get to be with everyone else,"" said Joyce.
""Imagine just walking past Usain Bolt, Mo Farah and Andy Murray. It would be a dream come true.""
Joyce, from St David's in west Wales, is the first Welsh women's rugby player to compete in the Olympics, something which she says is ""pretty insane"".
""I'm getting so much support,"" Joyce added.
""When I went home a couple of weeks ago to my parents' house they had the GB flags and the Welsh flags all around the house.

He was well known for buying and then selling the MGM film studio three times, making a profit each time.
Kerkorian was reported to have died on Monday night in Los Angeles but no cause of death has been given.
""Mr Kerkorian was a quiet but powerful force behind the transformation of the Las Vegas Strip into one of the world's most popular tourist destinations,"" MGM Resorts said in a statement.
A school dropout at 16, Kerkorian became a boxer and later flew dangerous missions delivering warplanes from Canada to Britain during World War Two.
He carried on flying after the war and opened a charter flight business ferrying gamblers who wanted to get from Los Angeles to Las Vegas more quickly than by driving.
He began buying property in Las Vegas in 1962 after selling his charter airline, which he later re-purchased.
""When you're a self-made man you start very early in life,"" he once told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ""You get a drive that's a little different, maybe a little stronger, than somebody who inherited.""
He was also a player in the automobile industry, losing a battle for control of Chrysler in the 1990s before taking stakes in General Motors and Ford in the 2000s.
In May this year, Forbes magazine estimated Kerkorian's wealth at $4.2bn (Â£2.7bn) after taking a hit on his investments during the financial crisis in 2008, when the magazine said he was worth $16bn.

Daryl Clark, Ben Westwood and Kevin Penny all crossed for the hosts before half-time to forge an 18-4 lead.
Ryan Atkins' brace, Benjamin Jullien and Westwood's second sealed Wire's biggest Super League win over Wigan.
The Warriors, for whom captain John Bateman scored a late consolation, would have gone top themselves with a win but defeat left them third.
Catalans Dragons will join Warrington at the summit on 20 points if they win at Hull on Friday.
The two tightest defences in the division at the start of play held firm until Charnley slid in at the corner after 17 minutes, but Shaun Wane's 150th game as Wigan head coach quickly turned sour as Clark and Westwood, who barged over with his first touch of the game, overturned the deficit.
Warrington, who lost winger Tom Lineham to a head injury early in the first half, saw off a burst of Wigan pressure before Atkins' close-range try stretched the lead to 20 points and his second effectively killed the contest.
The Wolves' half-back pairing of Stefan Ratchford and Kurt Gidley, who extended his contract on Wednesday, played influential roles throughout, with Gidley also landing five of his six attempts at goal.
Former Great Britain international Iestyn Harris, BBC Radio 5 live sports extra

""For 60 minutes they totally dominated Wigan - physically, in ability and for me that little bit of hunger. They really wanted this.
""They've put a statement of intent there - they've put 40 points on Wigan Warriors.

""I love watching Ben Westwood - he's tough, hard, effective and keeps going. He's doing a great job for us.""
Wigan head coach Shaun Wane: ""It's not tough to take - they were the better team. Warrington were outstanding.
""For 25 minutes we handled them physically, but we made changes and lost a bit of momentum.

30277998,"South and West Yorkshire would both control some tax and spending if local councils devolve powers to new combined authorities run by a mayor.
Under the proposals, strategic planning, transport and economic regeneration powers would be handed over.
The Chancellor, George Osborne, could announce the plan on Wednesday.
The five West Yorkshire councils - Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds and Wakefield - joined the neighbouring City of York in North Yorkshire to form a combined authority six months ago.
Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield councils have created a similar South Yorkshire body.
The existing councils would continue to run services such as education and waste management individually.
Under the current agreement one of the council leaders is chosen by the others to chair the combined authority.
The chancellor's idea takes this on much further with extra powers for the combined authority to control social welfare policy, raise tax and control public spending. In return leadership would be given to a new generation of ""metro mayors"" wielding considerable executive powers.
Councillor Peter Box, Labour leader of Wakefield City Council and current chair of the West Yorkshire Combined Authority, said he would welcome any extra power and budgets but totally reject a regional executive mayor.
Wakefield, Bradford, Leeds and Sheffield all rejected individual city mayors in referendums just two years ago.
""Just a couple of weeks ago the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was in Leeds and told us that we could have the devolved powers without having to accept an executive mayor,"" said Mr Box.
""Go on any street and it becomes clear the public will simply not accept another elected politician.""
Andrew Carter, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on Leeds City Council, voted against creating a local executive mayor in the 2012 referendums.
""But, a metro mayor is a completely different proposition,"" he said.
Support for the idea has come from two of Bradford's MPs.
Gerry Sutcliffe, Labour MP for Bradford South, who was leader of the city council before being elected to parliament, says West Yorkshire has to follow the Manchester lead or it will see potential investment and economic growth being sucked over to the other side of the Pennines.
George Galloway, Respect MP for Bradford West, said he believed that West Yorkshire could reap the same benefits that have resulted from the strong leadership of London's mayors.
""We have had two now, both of them bigger-than-life figures, who have clearly made a difference to London,"" he said.
The individual councils would not enter into a formal merger. A similar arrangement has been announced for Greater Manchester's 10 councils.
""I am a great believer in the power of our cities to be big forces in the world,"" Mr Osborne said as he signed the deal with the Greater Manchester councils in November.
""Great cities like Manchester don't quite have a strong enough voice. And I want to improve that. I think you do that by having a directly elected mayor. I think that has worked in London"".",Parts of Yorkshire could be run by a London-style directly-elected mayor if new plans are proposed in the government's Autumn Statement.
36458472,"The 30-year-old from Ashford, Kent, admitted the offences against victims aged between six months and 12 years, from 2006 to 2014.
He was given 22 life sentences and will serve a minimum term of 23 years.
It is believed Huckle abused up to 200 children from mainly poor communities in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.
He presented himself as a practising Christian and first visited Malaysia on a teaching gap year when he was 18 or 19. He then went on to groom children while doing voluntary work.
Sentencing Huckle, Judge Peter Rook QC said: ""It is very rare indeed that a judge has to sentence sexual offending by one person on such a scale as this.""
He added that Huckle's life ""revolved around your obsession with your own sexual gratification by child sex abuse"".
How abuser Richard Huckle was caught
Malaysian reaction to Huckle's abuse
""It is also clear that, had you not been arrested, you planned to continue the same lifestyle using the expertise that you were keen to show off to and share with other abusers so as to continue your sexual exploitation of the children of such communities.""
Investigators found more than 20,000 indecent pictures and videos of his assaults on children, which were shared with paedophiles worldwide through a website hidden in the so-called dark web
He even tried to make a business out of his abuse by crowd-funding the release of the images and was compiling a paedophile's manual at the time of his arrest by the National Crime Agency in December 2014.
He boasted about his crimes in online posts, saying in one discussion that ""impoverished kids are definitely much easier to seduce than middle-class Western kids.""
Ahead of his sentencing, Huckle claimed to a psychiatrist that he wanted to put his ""madness"" behind him and settle down with a south Indian woman.
But the court was shown a posting from 2013 in which he outlined his plan to marry one of his victims in order to help him abuse more children.
Judge Rook said: ""In my view, you may well harbour feelings of regret but there is no feeling of genuine remorse in this case.""
James Traynor from the NCA's child exploitation and online protection command said Huckle had ""deliberately travelled to a part of the world where he thought he could abuse vulnerable children without being caught"".
""He spent several years integrating himself into the community in which he lived, making himself a trusted figure. But he abused that trust in the worst possible way.
The NCA were able to use legislation which allows UK nationals to be prosecuted in the UK for offences that have been committed overseas.
Mr Traynor added: ""Borders are no barrier - we are determined that those who go abroad to abuse children will be held to account.""
The NCA has now referred itself to the police watchdog over the way it handled parts of its inquiry.
Huckle is known to have returned to the UK and attended two churches in Kent and London.
But the BBC has learned that the NCA only contacted the churches - which cannot be identified for legal reasons - last week, almost 18 months after Huckle was first arrested.
It says it has now referred that aspect of its investigation to the Independent Police Complaints Commission to see if it could have improved its response.",British man Richard Huckle has been jailed for life by a judge at the Old Bailey after admitting 71 charges of sex abuse against children in Malaysia.

The Outlet opened on the outskirts of Banbridge in County Down in 2007, but was effectively taken over by Ulster Bank in 2011.
Junction One opened near Antrim in 2004.
Ulster Bank also lent the money for that development.
The Outlet is currently held by an Ulster Bank company called West Register (Northern Ireland) Property.
It is a Northern Ireland branch of a group of companies set up by the bank's parent company RBS to hold ""distressed properties"".
Earlier this year another West Register firm sold the Richmond Centre in Londonderry.
The Outlet was opened in 2007 at a cost of £70m but struggled to fill all its units.
There are plans to switch part of its use from retail to leisure with a cinema and restaurants.
The last set of accounts for the company that holds Junction One valued the development at £7.85m, compared to a valuation of almost £80m in 2009.
Junction One Ltd had Ulster Bank borrowings of about £48m and its liabilities outweigh its assets by £53m.

33959446,"Archbishop Philip Tartaglia said Scottish bishops were ""shamed and pained"" by the suffering of those who had been harmed.
His apology followed the publication of a report from the McLellan Commission, which was set up to investigate abuse.
It called on the church to make an ""unmistakeable and unequivocal"" apology and ""heal the hurt"" of victims.
In response, Archbishop Tartaglia said: ""As the president of the Bishops' Conference, and on behalf of all the bishops of Scotland, I want to offer a profound apology to all those who have been harmed and who have suffered in any way as a result of actions by anyone within the Catholic Church.
""Child abuse is a horrific crime. That this abuse should have been carried out within the church, and by priests and religious, takes that abuse to another level.
""Such actions are inexcusable and intolerable. The harm the perpetrators of abuse have caused is first and foremost to their victims, but it extends far beyond them, to their families and friends, as well as to the church and wider society.""
He told survivors that the Catholic Bishops of Scotland were ""shamed and pained by what you have suffered"".
And he added: ""We say sorry. We ask forgiveness.
""We apologise to those who have found the church's response slow, unsympathetic or uncaring and reach out to them as we take up the recommendations of the McLellan Commission.""
The church asked Dr Andrew McLellan to lead a review of how it handles allegations of abuse following a series of scandals.
It took evidence from victims in a bid to improve support services and protect vulnerable children and adults.
Dr McLellan, a former moderator of the Church of Scotland, was tasked with coming up with proposals aimed at making the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland ""a safe place for all"".
The 11 review commissioners, who include a senior police officer, a journalist and an MP, were tasked with assessing the quality of support available to survivors.
It was not within the scope of the commission to investigate or adjudicate on current or historical allegations.
The commission made eight recommendations, including calling for support for survivors of abuse to be an ""absolute priority"".
It also said justice must be done for those who have been abused.
The report also recommended that the church's safeguarding policies and practices be completely rewritten and subject to external scrutiny.
It called for a consistent approach to dealing with allegations across Scotland and improved training for those in the church.
Mr McLellan said: ""The Bishops' Conference of Scotland should make a public apology to all survivors of abuse within the church.
""An apology must be made in a way that is unmistakeable and unequivocal.""
He added: ""The Bishops have said from the outset that they will accept our recommendations.
""That means that three things will happen.
""First and most important a beginning will be made to heal the hurt and address the anger which so many survivors feel.
""Second, the Catholic Church in Scotland will begin to confront a dark part of its past and find some healing for itself.
""Third, a significant step will be taken in restoring public credibility for the Catholic Church.""
Archbishop Tartaglia confirmed that the bishops had agreed to accept the recommendations in full.
The review was announced following a series of scandals.
The Church faced allegations of abuse at the former Catholic boarding school at Fort Augustus Abbey in the Highlands.
The former leader of the Catholic Church in Scotland, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, stepped down in February 2013 after admitting sexual misconduct.
The church said it would make public annual audits of all allegations received by the church.
It has published details of allegations dating from 2006 to 2012 and then for 2013.
The church also said it would instigate a retrospective investigation of historic allegations, dating back to 1947 - with work continuing on that.
It said any allegations uncovered as part of this, which had not been acted upon, would be passed to police for them to investigate.","The Roman Catholic Church in Scotland has issued a ""profound apology"" to victims of child abuse."

Hawaiian officials have urged residents to stock up on emergency supplies.
The last cyclone to hit Hawaii, Hurricane Iniki in 1992, killed six and caused $2.4bn (Â£1.4bn) in damage.
Five to eight inches of rain are forecast, along with heavy winds and potential flash flooding in some parts of the state.
The storm was weakening as it hit the terrain of the eastern-most island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, according to Chris Brenchley, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Honolulu.
""As wind blows into the terrain, the terrain kind of redirects the wind,"" he said.
The state's department of emergency management has asked residents to prepare a seven-day emergency kit, including non-perishable food and water.
Hawaii's remoteness from the mainland makes it hard to get emergency supplies to the state. Stores have had to quickly restock bottled water and other supplies.
The storm has already knocked out power for more than 18,000 people on the Big Island, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. Another 2,700 were without power on the island of Maui.
At least 50 flights from major airlines were canceled on Thursday and an inter-island airline cancelled all of its flights on Friday.

""Sympathy action is legal in most other countries, it should also be legal here,"" Mr Corbyn said.
The Tories said the remarks show Labour is a ""threat"" to economic security.
Asked if he would end the ban on secondary strike action - also known as solidarity action - brought in by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government in 1990, Mr Corbyn said: ""Yes, of course"".
He added: ""Nobody willingly goes on strike. They go on strike as an ultimate weapon... So let's look at the causes of people being upset rather than the symptoms.""
Reaction to Sunday's political interviews
Mr Corbyn also did not rule out allowing the return of flying pickets - where workers travels to support others' action - which were first used in the coal disputes of the 1970s.
He said: ""It was merely people moving around showing support during a very difficult industrial dispute.""
Referring to the walkout by junior doctors in their dispute with the government about a new contract, Mr Corbyn said they ""would be better served if we had a health secretary who was prepared to get involved, meet them and look for a solution"".
There were calls for the laws on secondary strikes to be repealed in 2005 while Labour was in power, amid action by baggage handlers at Heathrow Airport in support of sacked staff at the catering firm Gate Gourmet. However, the government then ruled out the prospect of lifting the ban.
The issue re-emerged three years later but then Prime Minister Gordon Brown said there would be ""no return"" to past laws.","A ban on sympathy strikes by unions not directly involved in a dispute would be repealed under a Labour government, the party's leader Jeremy Corbyn has said."
37821317,"But who will win it on goal difference? Data company Gracenote has the answer, but you'll have to scroll down for their prediction.
In the meantime, it's looking bleak for the Black Cats of Sunderland at the other end of the table.
After 10 games, they have just two points in the bag, are bottom of the pile and have just a 19% chance of avoiding the drop into the Championship.
Gracenote say they will finish on 28 points, well adrift of safety, although they will not be the worst side in Premier League history.
They will not even be the worst Sunderland side in the top flight.
The Black Cats managed 15 points in 2005-06 and 19 in 2002-03, relegated to the Championship on both occasions.
There is a sliver of hope for Sunderland boss David Moyes, though.
Crystal Palace and Everton managed just three points from their opening 10 matches in the 2013-14 and 1994-95 seasons respectively but stayed up.
For the record, the worst Premier league performers are Derby County, who collected just 11 points - one win and eight draws - in 2007-08.
It will perhaps come as no surprise to learn that Leicester City's hopes of retaining their crown are already over.
According to Gracenote, the Foxes have a 0.1% chance of emulating their success of last season. Currently 11th, they are predicted to finish eighth.
It is looking bleak, too, for Manchester United.
Their title chances are rated at just 1.3% by Gracenote, who think Jose Mourinho's side will finish in sixth on 64 points, well adrift of the top four.
That is one place lower and two points fewer than last season, which ended with an FA Cup victory but with manager Louis van Gaal losing his job.
Worse news for United fans is that neighbours Manchester City will finish top, pipping Arsenal on goal difference.
Gracenote predicted City and the Gunners would battle it out for the title before the season started and the duo are currently locked on 23 points at the top.
Liverpool have also collected 23 points thanks to seven wins and two draws from their opening 10 games, but Gracenote predicts Jurgen Klopp's side will ultimately finish three points back in third.
""Liverpool are still improving and we may be underestimating them still,"" says Simon Gleave, Gracenote Sports' head of analysis.
The fourth and final Champions League spot will go to Chelsea in Antonio Conte's first season in charge, with Tottenham four points back in fifth.

19673732,"A second soldier was moderately wounded in the incident, near Mount Arif, said army spokeswoman Avital Leibovich.
Lt Col Leibovich said the militants had opened fire on the soldiers after crossing the border from Sinai.
The troops were guarding a site where work is continuing on a new security barrier along the border with Egypt.
The violence comes amid a crackdown by Egypt on Islamist militants operating in the Sinai Peninsula, launched after an attack last month left 16 Egyptian soldiers dead.
In that incident, the militants subsequently crossed the border with Israel in an apparent attempt to carry out another attack. However, they were killed in Israeli air strikes.
In June, militants fired an anti-tank missile at a vehicle convoy carrying construction workers helping to build the new border fence. One Israeli construction worker and two of the attackers were killed.
Analysts say that the security situation in Sinai has deteriorated following the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last year, and that local Bedouin criminal gangs, radical Palestinian groups and possibly militant Islamists sympathetic to al-Qaeda have gained a foothold.
By Kevin ConnollyBBC News, Jerusalem
Israel's border with Egypt in the baking, hostile wilderness of the Sinai desert was among the most dangerous flashpoints in the Middle East until the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979. They had been to war four times there in the previous 30 years.
Under Anwar Sadat and then Hosni Mubarak, Egypt kept an iron grip on the region offering Israel such strategic certainty that the border between the two countries was not properly fenced.
Since the fall of Mubarak concern is deepening in Israel that Egypt is less able, or less willing to maintain the same degree of control. There have been a series of incursions over the last year - in the most serious, militants killed 16 Egyptian soldiers before blasting their way through the border fence.
Israel fears more - and is building a fence which will run the entire length of the frontier. This latest attack came at one of the last points where work is still to be completed.
Lt Col Leibovich said the militants who crossed the border from the Sinai peninsula on Friday were heavily armed with rifles and equipped with bullet-proof vests and explosive belts.
The attack happened about half-way down Israel's 240km (150-mile) southern border, at a point where work is under way to complete the new barrier.
""[The militants] opened fire towards IDF troops that were guarding the workers in that area. Another force that was nearby... rushed to the area and targeted those three terrorists,"" Lt Col Leibovich told reporters.
""A very big terror attack was thwarted by the quick response of these soldiers,"" she added.
The dead Israeli soldier, named as 20-year-old Cpl Netanel Yahalomi, was reportedly shot in the head during the gun battle.
Egyptian security sources said one of the militants died when his explosive belt was detonated, while the other two were shot dead by the Israeli soldiers. The nationalities of the assailants were not immediately clear.
Defence officials said work on the border fence in the Mount Arif area was due to conclude in early November. Construction had been delayed because it was difficult in a remote, mountainous region, they added.
Israel's options in responding to Friday's attack are constrained, reports BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus.
In the past it has chosen to attack Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, prompting rocket fire on Israel in return. But an Israeli strike into Egyptian territory is almost certainly ruled out; such a step could send already delicate Israel-Egypt ties into a downward spiral, our correspondent says.
Now both Israel and the US will be urging the Egyptian authorities to devote even more attention to security in Sinai, he adds.","An Israeli soldier and three militants have been killed in a clash inside Israel near its southern border with Egypt, the Israeli military has said."
17745366,"The transit was a  
          very rare astronomical event
 that would not be seen again for another 105 years.
Observers in north and central America, and the northern-most parts of South America saw the event start just before local sunset.
The far northwest of America, the Arctic, the western Pacific, and east Asia witnessed the entire passage.
While the UK and the rest of Europe, the Middle East, and eastern Africa waited for local sunrise to try to see the closing stages of the transit.
Venus appeared as a small black dot moving slowly but surely across the solar disc.  The traverse lasted more than six and a half hours.
Some of the best pictures of the event were provided by the  
          US space agency's (Nasa) Solar Dynamics Observatory
, which studies the Sun from a position 36,000km above the Earth.
""We get to see Venus in exquisite detail because of SDO's spatial resolution,"" said agency astrophysicist Dr Lika Guhathakurta.
""SDO is a very special observatory. It takes images that are about 10 times better than a high-definition TV and those images are acquired at a temporal cadence of one every 10 seconds.  This is something we've never had before.""
Many citizens keen to observe the transit first hand attended special events at universities and observatories where equipment for safe viewing had been set up.
In Hawaii, one of the best places to see the whole event, the university's  
          Institute of Astronomy
 set up telescope stations on Waikiki beach.
""We've had 10 telescopes and the queues have been 10 deep to each telescope all day long,"" said the institute's Dr Roy Gal.
""It's a great opportunity to get people excited and teach them stuff. I was hoping for a big turn-out, and it's been fantastic,"" he told BBC News.
Joe Cali
 viewed the transit on the edge of the Outback in New South Wales, Australia, another ideal vantage point.
""It is exciting. It may look like just a black dot on the Sun but if you think about it, it's one of the few times you get to see a planet in motion,"" he said.
UK skywatchers had to deal with quite extensive cloud conditions across the country.
""We've had total cloud and rain,"" said Brian Sheen from the  
          Roseland Observatory in Cornwall
.
""But we've been improving our chances by connecting with the Shetland Islands and the people up there have done rather better than we have.  We've been seeing the transit through [a feed] of one of their telescopes,"" he explained.
Scientists observed the transit
 to test ideas that will help them probe Earth-like planets elsewhere in the galaxy, and to learn more about Venus itself and its complex atmosphere.
Venus transits occur four times in approximately 243 years; more precisely, they appear in pairs of events separated by about eight years and these pairs are separated by about 105 or 121 years.
The reason for the long intervals lies in the fact that the orbits of Venus and Earth do not lie in the same plane and a transit can only occur if both planets and the Sun are situated exactly on one line.
This has happened only seven times previously in the telescopic age: in 1631, 1639, 1761, 1769, 1874, 1882 and 2004.
The next pair will not now occur until 2117 and 2125.
The phenomenon has particular historical significance. The 17th- and 18th-Century transits were used by the astronomers of the day to work out fundamental facts about the Solar System.
Employing a method of triangulation (parallax), they were able to  
          calculate the distance between the Earth and the Sun - the so-called astronomical unit (AU)
 - which we know today to be about 149.6 million km (or 93 million miles).
This allowed scientists to get their first real handle on the scale of things beyond Earth.

Venus transit: Your pictures
Modern instrumentation now gives us very precise numbers on planetary positions and masses, as well as the distance between the Earth and the Sun. But to the early astronomers, just getting good approximate values represented a huge challenge.
This is not to say the 2012 Venus transit was regarded as just a pretty show with no interest for scientists.
Planetary transits have key significance today because they represent one of the best methods for finding worlds orbiting distant stars.
Nasa's Kepler telescope
, for example, is identifying thousands of candidates by looking for the tell-tale dips in light that accompany a planet moving in front of its host sun.
These planets are too far away to be visited by spacecraft in the foreseeable future, but scientists can learn something about them from the way the background star's light is affected as it passes through the planetary atmosphere.
And observing a transiting Venus, which has a known atmospheric composition, provides a kind of benchmark to support these far-flung investigations.
Researchers also took a close look at Venus itself during the transit, used the occasion to probe the middle layers of the planet's atmosphere - its mesosphere.
They were  
          looking for a very thin arc of light, called the aureole
, which can only be seen when Venus appears to just touch the edge of the Sun's disc at ingress and egress.
The brightness and thickness of the aureole depends on the density and temperature of the atmospheric layers above Venus's cloud tops.
Observations of the aureole were being combined with data from  
          Europe's Venus Express spacecraft
 in orbit around the planet to provide information on high-altitude winds.
The Venusian atmosphere experiences super-rotation. That is - the whole atmosphere circles the planet in four Earth days, on a body that turns around just once in 243 Earth days.

30032857,"Phillip Smith, 40, was arrested in a hostel in Rio de Janeiro by Brazilian police. He is expected to be extradited or deported.
Smith used a passport in his birth name, Phillip Traynor, to fly to Chile and then go to Brazil on 6 November.
He escaped while on a three-day release from a prison south of Auckland.
Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 after he murdered the father of a 13-year-old boy he had sexually abused between 1992 and 1995.
The family had moved house but he had tracked the boy to their new home in Wellington in December 1995.
He repeatedly stabbed the father, killing him. The boy managed to escaped and raise the alarm.
The victim, who is now 30, told New Zealand's Fairfax media after news of Smith's capture, that he could now stop sleeping with a knife under his pillow.
""It's great news, it's excellent,"" he said from his new home in Australia. ""[I feel] relief, a bit of peace of mind that I can carry on with my life without having that fear over my shoulder.""
Smith's escape has thrown Corrections and various other government agencies into controversy. It has led to calls for an overhaul of short-term prison release and the monitoring of high-risk offenders.
In an email Smith sent to Radio New Zealand he said he had planned the escape by running a criminal check on his birth name and discovering that it had not been red-flagged.
""My only anxiety was that somebody that knew me might happen to be at the airport at the same time to identify me,'' he wrote, according to Radio NZ.
He also said he had been able to fund the escape with money from various businesses he had run from prison.
Smith said he chose Brazil because he thought it would be more difficult to extradite him if he was caught, as the two countries do not have a formal extradition treaty.
He was arrested after a member of the public in Rio De Janeiro recognised him from images being circulated in hostels and tipped off police. Smith appeared in court after his arrest and has been remanded in custody for 60 days.
New Zealand Police Detective Superintendent Mike Pannett said in a press conference on Thursday that it was a relief to have Smith back in custody.
He would not, however, say how long he expected Smith to remain in Brazil.
""New Zealand will bring him back as soon as possible but we are reliant on the Brazilian justice system to process and deal with the situation,"" Mr Pannett said.
Criminal Bar Association President Tony Bouchier said police needed to be more thorough when checking the names of criminals.
""There's got to be a far more robust process gone through when police are entering people's names into their systems and starting somebody off with a criminal record,"" he told Radio NZ.
Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga urged a review of the incident ""so we can make some decisions as to how we can improve how we have temporary releases done out in the community"", according to Radio New Zealand.","A New Zealand man serving a life sentence for child molestation and murder who escaped to Brazil is now in custody, New Zealand police say."
23128956,"Emma West, 36, of New Addington, admitted racially-aggravated disorderly behaviour likely to cause harassment or distress at Croydon Crown Court.
West was filmed shouting racist abuse at passengers travelling on a tram between Croydon and Wimbledon.
She was bound over to keep the peace and handed a 24-month community order.
A judge said West was clearly suffering from mental health problems at the time of the outburst.
She received a mental health treatment order for assaulting a constable in a separate incident.
The court heard she was ""reeking of alcohol"" when she carried out the verbal attack.
Prosecutor Julius Capon said: ""She in essence persecuted a number of passengers on the tram, subjecting them to some disgusting racial abuse.""
The things she said included ""you're not English"", ""none of you are English"" and ""get back to your own countries"".
Mr Capon said many of the passengers were ""upset"" by West's behaviour.
""Some of them described themselves as being disgusted, shocked and horrified,"" he said.
David Martin-Sperry, defending West, said the defendant's offending was out of character, she was taking anti-depressants and she does not harbour any racist views.

12746993,"It gives them the same rights as married couples regarding inheritance, pensions and tax allowances.
The law comes into effect on 6 April. Civil partnerships gained legal recognition in the UK in 2006.
Allan Bell, MHK, Minister for Economic Development, who tabled the bill says gay rights have been brought in line with the UK after a 20-year battle.
""It has been an extremely difficult time for gay people wishing to have open, loving caring relationships,"" he said.
""But gay rights have changed beyond recognition over the last 20 years on the island. It is a very different place now, it is more tolerant, understanding and inclusive.""
The Isle of Man has its own parliament and own laws, some of which are very different to those in the UK.
Abortion laws are much stricter, the death penalty was only abolished in 1993 and homosexuality was illegal until 1992.
Same-sex couples on the island have welcomed the bill claiming they have been discriminated against for years.
One man told the BBC that he and his partner were forced to take HIV tests in order to get a mortgage and life insurance on the island.
""I told our broker in no uncertain terms that I didn't want to take out a policy with someone who discriminated against gay people but most on them on the island weren't prepared to give a policy unless the HIV test was taken,"" he said.
Mr Bell said the island used to have ""a very negative image with the UK and Europe"".
""The island was subject to a boycott of the UK trade unions who used to use the island for a lot of their conferences,"" he said.
""We are trying to compete internationally for business and there is still the suspicion that we tend to be a backward society.""
""That is no longer the case. This legislation is a major statement to the outside world that we have changed. ""
The bill has now passed through both houses of parliament but not without resistance. It has sparked fierce debate among some groups on the island.
Peter Murcott, Methodist preacher, said: ""It will have a fundamental change in due course on how the next generation is brought up to conceive family life and ultimately it is going to introduce an anti-Christian attitude and it will be contrary to the beliefs of many other religions as well.""
Allan Bell said: ""Not everyone will feel comfortable with this legislation but it's been a much easier debate than the fierce resistance we had 20 years ago when we first started this process.
""The gay community on the Isle of Man has been a repressed community on the island for many years.
""Today is a red letter day for the island and for those groups.""",Gay couples on the Isle of Man will get the right to a civil partnership after a new law was signed in Tynwald.
26885910,"Smith, 93, was one of the most influential guitar-players in country and early rock 'n' roll.
He found fame with his 1948 single Guitar Boogie and enjoyed other hits including Feudin' Banjos in 1955.
When the Warner Bros film studio used a cover version and renamed it Dueling Banjos for Deliverance, he sued them and won substantial royalties.
As well as being a musician, Smith also ran a recording studio and record labels and had a successful career as a radio and TV presenter.
The Arthur Smith Show, on WBTV, was syndicated across the US and ran for 32 years.
He was nicknamed Arthur ""Guitar Boogie"" Smith after the title of his breakthrough tune, which became a hit around the world.
In Liverpool in 1957, a young Paul McCartney played it during his first concert with The Quarrymen, who went on to become The Beatles.
But nerves got the better of McCartney, who made a mess of it. ""I was just too frightened,"" he later said.

""Onwards and upwards from here. Thanks for the support.""
Sturridge scored 24 goals from 33 appearances last season but has been blighted by injuries this term, appearing in only 18 matches.
It is the second time this season he has travelled to the States in an attempt to rectify his fitness problems.
Towards the end of a five-month absence with a thigh problem sustained on international duty in early September - which was then followed by a calf strain - he spent 10 days in Los Angeles as part of his rehabilitation.
The striker has not featured since playing 85 minutes of the FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn on 8 April.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers last week said the club's medical team believed they had made a breakthrough in the diagnosis of Sturridge's injuries, which the player has previously suggested may be hereditary.
""I think we have found some underlying issues that maybe relate to Daniel's problems this season and the ongoing ones he's had,"" Rodgers said.","Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has had ""successful"" surgery on a hip injury in the United States."

Newcastle had taken the lead in extra time when Mohamed Diame prodded home Vurnon Anita's cross to score against his former club.
The lead lasted a minute, Robert Snodgrass equalising after Matz Sels had spilled Markus Henriksen's shot into his path.
Mbokani was sent off in the 89th minute for lunging forward with his head at Jamaal Lascelles.
The tie only came to life in extra time, the first 90 minutes featuring just two shots on target.
Newcastle have now lost nine of their 10 penalty shootouts in all competitions, yet Rafael Benitez's side will be wondering why they did not win the tie in 120 minutes.

Hull had just one shot on target in normal time, and their hopes of reaching the semi-finals looked over when Mbokani was sent off.
The forward, on loan from Dynamo Kiev, kicked out and pushed Lascelles before lunging forward at the Newcastle defender with his head.

30473388,"He was selected to fight the South Basildon and East Thurrock seat after ex-Tory MP Neil Hamilton pulled out.
In a recording obtained by the Mail On Sunday, Mr Smith made offensive remarks about gay people, other UKIP members and Chigwell in Essex.
He later issued a ""wholehearted and unreserved apology"".
UKIP leader Nigel Farage told BBC News that Mr Smith had resigned ""by mutual consent"", and described his behaviour as ""loutish and wholly inappropriate"".
He said UKIP had had ""great difficulty"" with the Basildon selection, adding: ""The party has got to grip this and sort it out, in short order"".
Mr Farage also said UKIP's national executive committee had the power to impose a candidate if it wanted.
UKIP hopes to make a serious challenge for the South Basildon and East Thurrock seat in the forthcoming general election, in which it is seeking to win a handful of seats and potentially hold the balance of power.
But Mr Smith's resignation, four days after he was re-adopted as a candidate, capped a week of negative headlines for the party.
Mr Hamilton pulled out of contention for the seat amid questions raised by the party over his expenses while another candidate, Natasha Bolter, withdrew amid an investigation into allegations she made against Mr Bird, whose job is to vet election candidates.
Following his resignation on Sunday, Mr Smith said in a statement: ""I want the best for South Basildon and Thurrock and I want to see the real issues discussed that touch the lives of people.
""Therefore I have chosen to resign so that UKIP can win this seat next May.""
A parliamentary candidate resigns having tried blaming his racist comments on taking painkillers.
This comes days after an alleged sex scandal at UKIP Head Office in which the party's chief executive did - or did not - sleep with another candidate.
Meantime a wealthy donor is said to be threatening to stop funding the party if his friend doesn't get a seat. You may think that UKIP's week of bad headlines is just a diverting soap opera.
You may think it simply shows the growing pains of Britain's fastest growing political force. You may think it has no significance at all. If so, you'd be wrong.

During the recorded conversation, Mr Smith talks about UKIP's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) group. He can be heard jokingly referring to it as BLT UKIP, and adds ""what the old poofter groups call themselves"".
He jokes about ""shooting peasants"" from the Essex town of Chigwell and supporting ""a peasant's hunt through Chigwell village"".
A UKIP spokesman confirmed to the BBC that Mr Smith had apologised to Mr Farage for allegations made against him during the phone call - which Mr Smith has since retracted.
UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe, the party's immigration spokesman, said that ""racist and homophobic language"" would not be tolerated.
""When there is someone who has come out and expressed these type of views, which I abhor and dislike intensely, we have acted rapidly and we have got them out,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme.
UKIP's candidates, he claimed, were ""ordinary people"" who did not have the media training that their political rivals had and sometimes had to be ""guided"".
But he insisted the way the party was dealing with problems as they arose showed how it had matured.
""What we have seen over the last ten days is that UKIP has grown up rather dramatically,"" he added.
Mr Smith stood for UKIP in the Basildon seat in 2010, where he came fourth behind the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems.
But the party now regards the seat as one that it could possibly win and the selection process is now likely to be re-opened.
After Mr Hamilton withdrew his candidacy for the Basildon seat earlier this week, Channel 4 reported seeing a letter from UKIP's finance committee querying expenses claims made by him.

36841810,"Officers are investigating whether one of the men fell from a 12th floor balcony of the 19-storey Donside Court, in the Tillydrone area of the city.
Emergency services were called to the building at about 20:15 on Tuesday evening.
A witness has described hearing a woman screaming ""help me, help me"" before police arrived.
Police Scotland said it believed the incident was contained and there was not a threat to the wider community.
A blue forensics tent had been erected inside a police cordon at the foot of the building, close to the main entrance.
An eyewitness said they saw a man fall from the 12th floor of the building, which police confirmed they were pursuing as a line of inquiry.
Another witness, Toni Dey, 19, who lives a short distance away in Gordon's Mills Road, said she heard screaming from the block.
The mother of two said: ""I heard some girl screaming 'Help me, help me', then about 10 minutes after I heard loads of screaming and shouting.
""I didn't call the police as I thought it was kids messing around, then I heard loads of police.
""It's very scary to think that something like that had happened. All I kept thinking was 'Why was that poor girl shouting help me?', and about a two-minute walk out my back door.
""I just moved in here in May and it's been so quiet. I was shocked to hear anything as I never normally do.""
Another woman told BBC Scotland that she had known one of the men involved, describing him as a ""nice boy"".
Det Supt Dave McLaren said further information about the incident would be released in due course.
""At this time the investigation is in its very early stages,"" he said.
""However, the circumstances as they present at this time would indicate that this is a contained incident and we are not looking for any other person in relation to the deaths.""
Police dismissed reports on social media that a police officer had been injured and said there was no suggestion the incident was terrorism-related.
Neighbour Susan Smith said police initially went up to the flat carrying what looked like a battering ram.
""There were loads and loads of police cars. I've never seen so many police cars. Four ambulance vans,"" she said.
""They took a lassie out and they were still trying to give the guy CPR. Then they put a tent up and the next thing forensics arrived.
""The police actually went in with a great thing like a battering ram at one point. Then they went in with stretchers and a chair thing - and came out with them empty.""
Councillor Martin Greig, chairman of Aberdeen Community Safety Partnership, said: ""There will be families grieving profoundly at this terrible news.
""Our sympathies are with those who have lost loved ones.
""The local community and the city will share feelings of shock at this violent incident.""",Police are searching the area around a tower block in Aberdeen where a woman and two men died in a disturbance.

26981576,"The House of Representatives passed the measure unanimously two days after the Senate approved it.
Hamid Aboutalebi was a part of the Muslim student group that seized the US embassy in Tehran in 1979.
The White House has told Iran Mr Aboutalebi was ""not viable"" but has not taken a position on the bill.
Fifty-two Americans were held for 444 days at the height of Iran's Islamic revolution, which saw pro-American Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi sent into exile and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini take power.
Mr Aboutalebi, who previously served as Iran's ambassador to Belgium, the European Union, Italy and Australia, told Iranian media his participation in the hostage crisis began only after the initial seizure of the embassy, and primarily involved translation.
On Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said, ""We've made clear and have communicated to the Iranians that the selection they've put forward is not viable.""
But he declined to say whether President Barack Obama would sign the bill into law.
The Iranian government, meanwhile, has called the US rejection of Mr Aboutalebi ""not acceptable"".
The bill passed on Thursday in the House denies entry into the US to individuals engaged in espionage or terrorism or who pose a threat to national security.
Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who introduced the legislation in the US Senate, urged Mr Obama to sign the bill.
""We, as a country, can send an unequivocal message to rogue nations like Iran that the United States will not tolerate this kind of provocative and hostile behaviour,"" Mr Cruz said.
The bill's sponsor in the House, Republican Doug Lamborn, said, ""Terrorists, from Iran or elsewhere, should not be allowed to walk the streets of Manhattan with diplomatic immunity.""
As the host country of the United Nations, the US has previously but rarely denied entry to an envoy or head of state. Those included a previous Iranian diplomat and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir.
In those cases the applications were withdrawn after the US signalled opposition, or the state department simply declined to process the visas.
Those options are available in Mr Aboutalebi's case.
On Monday, Iranian foreign ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham told state-run media he had previously received a US visa as part of a visit to the UN in the 1990s.
In an interview with an Iranian news site, Mr Aboutalebi said he was not part of the group that took over the US embassy and was only later asked to translate for the students.
Others involved in the hostage-taking have corroborated that account.",The US Congress has sent a bill to the president that would bar Iran's pick for ambassador to the UN from entering the country.

The company has signed an agreement with Spanish firm Gamesa to supply turbines to the site near New Luce.
Delivery of the 96 turbines is expected to begin in February 2016.
The site is expected to be completed in early 2017.
Keith Anderson, CEO of ScottishPower Renewables, said: ""Kilgallioch wind farm will become our second largest wind farm in the UK and this year marks a real milestone as we approach 2 GW of installed onshore wind capacity - enough to power more than one million homes.
""We are delighted to reach this agreement with Gamesa, and we look forward to work commencing on the site next month.""
The firm has previously claimed the development could meet the energy needs of more than 130,000 homes and its construction will create about 200 jobs.

Pope Francis also met elderly survivors of the camp, kissing them on the cheeks and speaking to them softly.
He is on his third day of a visit marking 1,050 years since Poland's adoption of Christianity.
Francis has become the third Pope to walk through the main gate of Auschwitz, under its infamous inscription ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" - work sets you free.
But unlike his German and Polish predecessors, he is not speaking about the horrors that occurred there, says the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw.
Francis passed under the gates alone, wearing white robes and skullcap. After meeting the survivors, he placed a candle at the Death Wall, where prisoners were executed by the Nazis, before continuing on his own.
The Pope stopped to pray at the prison cell of Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish Catholic friar who sacrificed his life to save that of another man. The Church made him a saint in 1982.

37472193,"English Heritage has organised the trek on horseback and foot from York to East Sussex to mark the 950th anniversary of the famous clash.
The volunteers will arrive on the battlefield 950 years to the day since Harold fought William of Normandy.
Nigel Amos, leader of the march for English Heritage, said it was a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"".
King Harold defeated a Viking army at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in East Yorkshire, on 25 September, 1066, before travelling south to face the Normans.
On 14 October, he fought and was killed at the Battle of Hastings.
William then seized the English throne.
Emily Sewell, head of events for English Heritage, said 1066 and the Battle of Hastings was ""one of the most famous battles and most transformative years in English history"".
Nigel Amos, who is leading the march on behalf of English Heritage, added: ""There's nothing like a personal experience to understand what it was like and offer an even more authentic window on that world to inspire and inform others.""","A group of ""warriors"" are staging a 300-mile march to echo King Harold's journey to the Battle of Hastings."
34772560,"""No matter what I did, I always felt I was fighting a losing battle,"" he said.
But Burgess said he had not been badly treated by England and refused to blame coach Stuart Lancaster.
The 26-year-old, who joined Bath last October, re-signed for the South Sydney Rabbitohs last week.
He was part of England's squad for the Rugby World Cup, in which they were eliminated at the group stage, and played in the hosts' crucial 28-25 defeat by Wales.
Burgess said criticism directed at him following his performance in that match had contributed to his feeling of unease in rugby union.
""A lot of people outside the England camp had an agenda against both England and, in some circumstances, me,"" he wrote in the Daily Mail.
""This was an upsetting factor to me, that people who are supposed to love the game are actually tearing it to shreds.
""Some ex-players just kept letting rip. It's almost like they don't want anyone else to do well in the jersey. I didn't want to stay in a sport like that.""
Burgess also said he had not found the 15-man code as enjoyable as rugby league.
""I want to spend the rest of my career playing the game that's in my heart,"" said Burgess, who played 21 games for Bath as a blind-side flanker after switching codes last year.
""What makes me love [rugby league] is the physical battle of it; I never found myself reaching that point [in union].
""My heart just isn't in [rugby union], and if my heart's not in it then [Bath and England] won't get the best performances from me.""
He said he was satisfied with his displays at the World Cup and believed coach Lancaster had been unfairly criticised after the team's early exit.
Burgess, whose selection for the World Cup squad ahead of the established Luther Burrell reportedly caused disquiet in the England camp, said his decision to quit union had dismayed his international and club team-mates.
""I wanted to go in and see [the Bath squad], but Stuart Hooper, our captain, said he didn't think I'd be well received there, which was fair enough,"" he said.","Former England centre Sam Burgess returned to rugby league because his ""heart wasn't in"" rugby union and because he was also stung by criticism from ex-players."

Sara Connor, 46, and her British boyfriend David James Taylor, 33, are both on trial for Mr Sudarsa's murder.
In court on Tuesday, his widow Ketut Arsini said she would not accept ""even a cent"" from Ms Connor.
The Australian woman read extracts to the Denpasar hearing of a handwritten letter she had sent to Ms Arsini offering 25m rupiah (Â£1500; $1900).
""I am not a rich person but to express my sympathy and my sadness I would like you to accept a donation of 25 million rupiah to help you and your children in this difficult moment,"" Ms Connor said.
People in the courtroom applauded when Ms Arsini said she did not want any money.
""I want the court to give the maximum punishment that fits what she did, based on Indonesian laws,"" Ms Arsini said.
Ms Connor again claimed her innocence, saying she tried to separate Mr Taylor and Mr Sudarsa after they began fighting over her missing handbag.

40532060,"King's has been collaborating with Technische UniversitÃ¤t Dresden on a research initiative, known as Transcampus, since 2015.
But, according to Times Higher Education, an ""offshore King's College Europe"" is now on the cards.
King's College confirmed that it was discussing potential further collaborations with TU Dresden.
The two institutions already offer 10 joint professorships and several joint PhD programmes through Transcampus.
However, its dean, Prof Stefan Bornstein, has told Times Higher Education that plans for the new King's campus are already ""in the process"".
Prof Bornstein, who is director and chairman of TU Dresden's department of medicine and an honorary consultant in diabetes and endocrinology at King's, said the plan would allow King's to have a presence in Europe and maintain access to European research funding post-Brexit.
Likewise, he said, TU Dresden would benefit from increased ties to London, one of the ""leading academic centres in the world"".
Prof Bornstein said the new campus would hopefully run new undergraduate courses ""linked to innovation and the needs of industry and society"".
The aim would be to recruit leading scholars from around the world, he added.
Prof Bornstein said the Transcampus project had been envisaged before the EU referendum but admitted that it had become ""a lot more interesting"" since the vote.
""We cannot allow things that have developed for so many years in a positive way [to be] hampered by political decisions that actually nobody wanted,"" he said.
""It's a nice way to have a solution to get around this very stupid Brexit idea.""
A number of UK universities are believed to be considering opening branch campuses in Europe after Brexit - though earlier this year Oxford University rejected reports that it was in talks to open a Paris campus.
Prof Bornstein said he would expect the Transcampus model to be replicated by other universities in the UK and Europe, but stressed that the key was a long history of collaboration between researchers at the two institutions.
In a statement, King's said the university valued the Transcampus initiative ""which demonstrates the success of cross-national and institutional links"".
""We will continue to work together in various fields on research and exchange and discuss potential further collaborations.""",King's College London could become the first British university to open a European campus since the referendum.

29603170,"In a thinly veiled attack on president Sepp Blatter's leadership, Michael Garcia reiterated the need for ""greater transparency"".
""The investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard,"" continued Garcia.
He added that the organisation needs a ""leadership that sends a message that the rules apply to everyone"".
Talking about the current investigation process, Garcia said: ""That's a kind of system which might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution that serves the public and is the subject of intense public scrutiny.""
American lawyer Garcia concluded his lengthy investigation into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process last month and handed his report to Fifa's ethics adjudicator Hans Joachim Eckert, but he is disappointed by the world governing body's insistence on keeping his report confidential.
In a keynote speech at an event organised by the American Bar Association in London, Garcia added: ""The natural next step of the development of an effective ethics process at Fifa is greater transparency.
""The second element that is vital to fulfilling the promise of this reform process is tone at the top.
""More simply put, the second element an institution like Fifa needs in order to meet the challenge of ethics enforcement is leadership. An ethics committee - even a serious, independent ethics committee backed by a strong code of ethics - is not a silver bullet.
""What is required is leadership that sends a message that the rules apply to everyone; leadership that wants to understand and learn from any mistakes or mis-steps the ethics committee may have identified; leadership that makes it clear to everyone - this is what we've set up the ethics committee to do, this is why they do it, and this is what they've done.
""It's that kind of leadership that breathes the life into a code of ethics. Because true reform doesn't come from rules or creating new committee structures. It comes from changing the culture of the organisation.""
Garcia's views on publishing the report have been supported by a number of Fifa executives, including Uefa president Michel Platini and Britain's representative Jim Boyce.
But Fifa president Blatter insists the contents of the report must remain confidential, and that no member of his executive committee made a specific request when the issue was raised in a meeting earlier this month.
Garcia said other sports organisations have already demonstrated the value of transparency, highlighting the publication of a report into allegations concerning the 2002 Winter Olympics being awarded to Salt Lake City, which allowed the International Olympic Committee to ""move forward"".
He added: ""We have seen that recently with the NFL where a lack of transparency in its initial investigation concerning Ray Rice fostered scepticism and questions about the integrity of its leadership. Now the NFL has has to bring in outside counsel to investigate the investigation.
""Notably, the NFL has made clear the results of the new investigation will indeed be made public.
""That in turn would help foster a culture of compliance internally and would promote more confidence in the system from the public, its partners and the millions of fans who follow and love the game.""
Garcia said the aim of transparency is not ""to embarrass certain individuals"" or ""harm the organization"", but rather the opposite.
""It's one thing to tell people that a rigorous process is in place. It's another thing to show them how that process works and what it has uncovered,"" he explained.
""Fifa built the system that should inspire confidence that things have changed for the better. Showing that to the public serves Fifa's best interest.""","Fifa's chief independent ethics investigator has called for a ""change of culture"" at the organisation."

Portsmouth Crown Court also heard the girl had run away from home.
Ms Ayrton, who has a son, admitted being previously sentenced at Bournemouth Crown Court in January last year.

But she denied confessing to the care worker that she was a paedophile, or saying: ""I have always known there was something wrong with me and I need help.""
Ms Talbot asked the defendant about her sexuality, and whether she had ""made any physical changes or enhancements"" to her body or was taking any medication.

He won five Premier League titles and each of the Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup once after joining from Everton for £27m in 2004.
Rooney, who has signed a two-year deal, said he was ""ecstatic"" and his ""first game back will be an emotional day"".
""It's a great feeling to be back. I cannot wait to meet the lads, get on the training pitch and then get on the pitch to play,"" he added.
Rooney's return comes as United look set to sign Everton striker Romelu Lukaku, with a £75m deal for the Belgium international agreed between the two clubs.
Everton confirmed Rooney will wear the number 10 shirt previously worn by Lukaku.
""I'm not just coming back because it's the team I support, the team I grew up playing for - I'm coming back because I feel the club can move forward and be successful,"" said Rooney, who scored 17 goals in 77 games in his first spell at Goodison.
""I want to be part of it. There will be pressure on me to perform, but I'm ready to go. I believe I can help move this club forward and be more successful on the pitch.""
Rooney says when he spoke to Everton manager Ronald Koeman, he ""saw it in his eyes that he wanted me to be part of his team"".
He added: ""It was a no-brainer for me and the only place I was going to go.""
Rooney said he told his agent Paul Stretford to ""go and speak to them, let's make it happen"" when he found out Everton were interested in signing him and it ""was obvious I was going to be leaving Manchester United this summer"".
""There were other options there but once I knew that Everton wanted me to come back then it was the only option for me,"" he added.

Koeman began talking about Rooney's potential return as far back as October, stating he would be ""pleased"" to sign England's all-time leading goalscorer.
On Sunday, he said: ""Wayne has shown me that ambition that we need and that winning mentality - he knows how to win titles and I'm really happy he's decided to come home.
""He loves Everton and he was desperate to come back. He is still only 31 and I don't have any doubts about his qualities. It's fantastic he's here.
""We have a lot of young players and sometimes in life you need somebody who you look up to, who you learn from. That was also one of the messages when we spoke about on and off the pitch what his function will be in the team.
""One of the functions for Wayne is to show the rest of the team why he is - and still is - that player.""
Rooney, who was often left out of United's starting line-up by manager Jose Mourinho last season, appeared in 25 league games - the fewest he has played in one season. His total of eight goals in all competitions was also the lowest of his career.
He also lost his place in the England squad, but has not retired from international duty and needs six more caps to equal goalkeeper Peter Shilton's all-time record of 125 appearances.
Rooney was an unused substitute as United beat Southampton to win the EFL Cup in February, and made only a brief appearance at the end of the Europa League final victory over Ajax in May.
In his 13 seasons with United, he finished as top scorer five times and shared the honour with Cristiano Ronaldo in another campaign. He was also named fans' player of the year twice.
""It is no secret that I have long been an admirer of Wayne,"" said Mourinho. ""He has been a model professional throughout his time at the club and will remain in the history books for many years to come.
""It is never easy to see a great player playing less football than he would like and I could not stand in his way when he asked to go back to Everton.
""His experience, focus and determination will be missed and I wish him well for the future.""
Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward added: ""Who can forget his storybook debut hat-trick against Fenerbahce, the spectacular overhead kick against Manchester City and the countless match-winning performances in his time here?
""But after much discussion, the club has decided to accept his request to rejoin his boyhood team.""

Andy Mitten, editor of fanzine United We Stand: ""The move is best for all parties.
""Rooney will be remembered well by United fans when the dust settles, a club legend who scored more goals than anyone and was a leading light in one of United's greatest sides.
""Reaching three European Cup finals in four years shows how good that team was. At his best, between 2004 and 2011, he was the finest British player of his generation.
""Rooney's performances dropped, and being linked with Chelsea and Manchester City did his popularity no favours either, but he's scored some of the greatest goals I've ever seen.
""As a journalist who has interviewed him several times over 12 years, I watched him mature, become more interesting and grow into being a respected Manchester United captain.""
Rooney was brought up by parents Jeanette and Wayne in the Croxteth area of Liverpool alongside brothers Graham and John, with all five members of the household avid Everton supporters.
He joined the Toffees at the age of nine and quickly built a reputation as a precocious talent, scoring 114 goals in 29 matches for the under-10 and under-11 sides.
David Moyes gave him his first-team debut in August 2002, and he quickly became a regular starter, scoring his first Premier League goal - a last-minute winner against Arsenal - five days before his 17th birthday.
I've kept it quiet for the last 13 years, but I've actually been wearing Everton pyjamas at home with my kids.
The goal led to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger describing Rooney as ""the biggest English talent I have seen since I arrived in this country"". Wenger added: ""He has everything you dream of for a front player - intelligent feet, quick reactions.""
Rooney became one of world football's highest-paid teenagers with his boyhood club, but handed in a transfer request in August 2004, leading to him being signed by Sir Alex Ferguson for what was the highest fee paid for a player under 20.

BBC Sport's Simon Stone: Rooney has been slowly eased out of the first team, without there being one single pressure point that signalled a change in Mourinho's thinking.
The Portuguese has consistently backed Rooney in public - saying as recently as May that he would be ""very happy"" if the striker stayed at Old Trafford.
But Rooney did not take the chances he was afforded by Mourinho last season, and that made his departure inevitable once Everton pursued their interest.
Rooney signed a new four-and-a-half-year contract during the 2013-14 campaign, which included the option of a further season, but the Old Trafford club had no intention of triggering that clause.
United have waived a fee and may also be funding part of Rooney's £13m wages.

35925020,"His journey towards the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games as a para-canoeist has been one filled with life-changing obstacles and defined by a steely resolve.
He began as a record-breaking junior world champion powerlifter. Then, after suffering a serious spinal injury, he embarked on an illustrious handcycling career.
Marsden raced on the European circuit while based in the Czech Republic, before a neck problem again saw him admitted into the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in 2009 for what he thought was a prolapsed disc.
Instead it was revealed that he suffers with a rare motor-neurone condition which affects his arms, legs and brain.
""Through powerlifting I damaged my back many years ago, and after that I managed to damage my neck and had a couple of plates and (carbon) cage put in,"" the 44-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent told BBC East Midlands Today.
In a matter-of-fact manner, Marsden says his sporting journey ""has not been an easy one"".
When handcycling was no longer an option, he took up air rifle shooting and set his sights on London 2012, but while more representative honours came his way, he missed out on the Paralympics.
Eventually, he turned to the water where he was able to combine aspects of his his first two sporting loves - powerlifting and handcycling - together in one explosive sport.
""I didn't want to give up on sport,"" he said. ""The cycling and powerlifting work quite well with the para-canoe - the gym work, the power and strength and then you have the endurance and speed work on the bike.""
The two-time para-canoe European champion and two-time world silver medallist now wants to realise his Paralympic ambition in Brazil when the British line-up is decided at the trials in Nottingham in June.
""It would be the highlight of my sporting career,"" Marsden said.
""As a kid I watched TV and watched the Olympics. I've seen how the Paralympics has built up over the years, from not really knowing what it was about to the status it has now, with athletes being household names.
""It would be an honour to represent Great Britain at the Paralympics.
""I'll be aiming for gold in Rio. There is no other place you want after all the hard work.""
At a warm weather training camp in Brazil, Marsden got a picture-perfect view of what he can look forward to if he does make the trip to Rio later this year.
Taking a look at the city's regatta venue on the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, the backdrop itself motivated him further.
""It's a fantastic place,"" he said. ""With Christ the Redeemer looking down on the regatta course, it has to be the best sporting location of any sport in the world.""

34834414,"Bringing together the major influences that shaped the city's cultural output Beirut-based curator and designer Rana Salam pinpoints the impact of external wars and civil conflict on design with an insider's eye for detail.
The French mandate ended in 1943, after 23 years of colonial rule, ushering in the new republic. But it was in the 1950s that architecture, interior and product design flourished fusing European and Arab influences. The economic emphasis shifted from agriculture to industry, tourism and trade, creating a new skyline, and growing consumerism encouraged brand advertising.
A 1960s poster (pictured) for Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national carrier, which began flying the newly wealthy to international destinations. The French-designed poster suggests it's made of mosaic while appearing modern, and designer Jacques Auriac - also responsible for the creating iconic French cigarette packets - conjured up posters to destinations beyond the immediate region.
Opening its doors in late 1967, the boutique L'Artisan du Liban et L'Orient was the response of May El Khoury, the wife of an eminent architect, to the trauma of defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The defeat eroded confidence and left a profound impression on the Arab psyche. Modernising overlooked local crafts and selling them in a chic setting might be interpreted as an act of cultural activism. It softened the humiliation of military defeat for the middle classes, who were attracted to the new Arab aesthetic and to the idea of patriotism through ethical consumerism.
The desire to create a contemporary Islamic architecture marked architect Assem Salam's early career in reaction to the 1967 war. Along with Pierre Khoury he felt the construction of specifically Lebanese-Arab religious buildings would revive spirits crushed by the defeat and designed the Khashoggi Mosque (pictured above). After the civil war he founded an association for the preservation of historic buildings seeking to slow down the rush to reconstruct Beirut at the cost of cultural heritage.
The nightclub known as B 018 was designed by Bernard Khoury in 1998 in the Quarantaine, the Beirut neighbourhood that saw some of the worst atrocities during the conflict. It has its roots in the 1980s in the thick of the civil war when gatherings were held at a semi-secret location code named B 018.
The circular lid covering the subterranean club looks like a helicopter landing pad from above. The lid can also be raised revealing activity below. Khoury claims that in the absence of public spaces above ground his club was designed not for entertainment but to bring people together for therapy.
The Egg, a scarred reminder of the civil war, stands near Martyrs Square. It was originally planned to be a cinema at the heart of the largest leisure and shopping complex in the Middle East, part of a modernist, avant-garde architectural movement, but it was unfinished when the civil war broke out in 1975. Fierce fighting around the building left the edifice pock-marked but still standing. This iconic building occasionally hosts cultural events.
The Basilica of the Cathedral of Harissa, designed by Pierre Khoury, is pictured at the top of the page. It stands on a hill overlooking a bay, next to an important Lebanese Christian pilgrimage site. The remarkable religious building was conceived with the idea of creating a stronger Christian identity after the 1967 war.","The main exhibition at this year's Dubai Design Week, Iconic City: Brilliant Beirut, presents a cleverly conceived display of the Lebanese capital's design evolution from 1950 until the present."
35536278,"Possibly the worst headline I've ever written. But before I'm accused of completely failing to perform basic contractual duties, allow me to explain why those seven words are rather important.
Since 2013, the BBC and almost every other leading news organisation in the UK has been locked in a bizarre battle to tell you the truth about Erol Incedal.
""Who he?"" I hear you ask. He's a student from London who was accused of preparing some kind of major terrorism plan. And then after two trials he was found not guilty of that allegation. But I can't tell you why.
The prosecution of Erol Incedal has been, without a shadow of a doubt, the strangest criminal trial that those of us who report on the law have ever seen.
Apologies. I meant to write ""not really seen much of"" because almost all of what happened was behind closed doors.
And now the Court of Appeal has ruled that the unprecedented gagging order in the case will remain in place forever.
Incedal was charged with another man, Mounir Rarmoul Bouhadjar, in October 2013. Rarmoul Bouhadjar admitted possessing bomb-making plans. Incedal denied the allegation, saying he had a reasonable excuse for holding them. In 2014, a jury convicted him of that, but they failed to agree whether he was guilty of a more serious charge of preparing an act of terrorism. At a retrial the following year, a fresh jury cleared him.
I don't know why that jury cleared him. If I did, I couldn't tell you. Some of my colleagues do however know. But they can't tell me. Or you. They'd be in Contempt of Court and could end up in prison.
Erol Incedal's trials involved an unprecedented level of secrecy in courts that are normally open to the public. There were brief periods of public evidence and then slightly longer periods when a group of accredited journalists were allowed in to listen to some of the mysterious evidence. The third and highest level of the case operated in complete secrecy, with the media totally banned.
At the end of each secret session that journalists could attend, police took their notebooks and put them in a safe. Where are those notebooks now? You know that scene at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark in which anonymous officials lock away Indiana Jones's greatest discovery? You get the idea.
And that's been the whole point of this legal battle - to try to find some way to peel the legal gaffer tape from my colleagues' mouths.
At the earliest stage of proceedings in 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) sought anonymity for the defendants.
Both the home and foreign secretaries had raised concerns with the CPS. lt later told the trial judge, Mr Justice Nicol, that should the ""factors of concern be ventilated in a public trial"", the prosecution would be ""presented with representations"" to drop the charges on grounds of national security.
Mr Justice Nicol ruled the case would be prosecuted ""in camera"". There would be a jury, as ever, but they would never be able to disclose what they heard. The Court of Appeal later modified that to allow journalists to attend some of the hearings - but with no guarantee that anything would ever become reportable.
So given those journalists still can't speak, and Erol Incedal can't say why he was acquitted of preparing an act of terrorism, is this a massive outrage to justice in a democracy?
Well, the Court of Appeal says not.
The general principle is that justice must be seen to be done  - but the law also says there can be myriad good reasons to withhold information from the public - not least for the protection of vulnerable witnesses and victims.
In the case of Erol Incedal, Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, said in Tuesday's Court of Appeal ruling the nature of the evidence was such that the trial judge had to lock the court's doors.
He and two other senior judges ruled that the trial judge had rightly considered that the national security material in the case had to be protected at all costs.
The Court of Appeal judgement recognises that secret hearings compromise the media's role in holding power to account: if justice cannot be seen to be done, how does one know if it is justice?
Lord Thomas offers the suggestion that the Intelligence and Security Committee could fill some of that vacuum - although it is, also, a semi-secret body.
So what happens now?
While the media gag is legal, the subtext of the Court of Appeal judgement makes clear that it doesn't want courts to lightly enter into the unique arrangements seen in the Incedal case.
Secondly, the judge fired a warning shot of sorts over the bows of MI5 and MI6. If the agencies were ordered in the future to disclose information for use in criminal trials, and the prosecutors want to go ahead, they cannot simply say no and remain in the shadows.
On the face of it, that is a pretty obvious statement that government and its agencies are not above the law - but it is also a clear sign that the next time a case like this comes up, the very high legal test for withholding information from the public remains in play.
Does that mean it will never happen again? Not at all. My instincts and experience make me suspect this won't be the last trial of its kind.",BREAKING: Reporter can't tell you what's happened.
37544646,"Ex-policeman Antony Lowry-Huws, 68, of Kinmel Bay, and Sheila Whalley, 70, of Abergele, were jailed in 2013 after duping lenders across north Wales.
Lowry-Huws' wife Susan, 63, who got a suspended sentence, must pay back the largest amount of £75,790.
The three were convicted of conspiracy to defraud along with two others.
At a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Mold Crown Court, it was agreed Antony Lowry-Huws and Whalley made £4m each from their crimes.
Lowry-Huws was ordered to repay £27,905, while developer Whalley will give back £18,350.
His wife, who was said to be on the periphery of the scam and under the influence of her husband, benefited £896,351 and must pay back £75,790.
During the trial, the court heard mortgage lenders were conned into lending thousands of pounds in mortgages on properties across north Wales, Cheshire and the north west of England.
The prosecution said the deceit was achieved by inflating the value of the property used as security, hiding that in some cases no deposit was put down, or inflating the rental income potential to make the mortgage rate more acceptable.
In some cases the homes on which mortgages were advanced did not exist.","Three people involved in one of the UK's biggest mortgage frauds, worth up to £24m, must repay some of the money they made."
33860521,"The YouGov poll for The Times of 1,400 eligible voters put Mr Corbyn on 53%, 32 points ahead of Andy Burnham.
The left-wing MP said his campaign was ""going very well"" but ballot papers had not yet been sent out.
Alastair Campbell has warned Labour risks ""driving itself off a cliff"" if Mr Corbyn is elected.
Tony Blair's former spokesman is urging support for ""anyone but Corbyn"" in the leadership vote, arguing that the Islington North MP could never win a general election.
Mr Corbyn, a backbencher who was seen as a rank outsider at the start of the campaign, has been packing out meeting halls across the UK, with many of his supporters joining the Labour Party to vote for him.
The party has gained 79,000 members since the general election and 145,000 registered supporters.
If the findings of the YouGov poll were repeated in the leadership election, Mr Corbyn would win without the need for second preferences to be counted.
YouGov president Peter Kellner said he ""would personally be astonished if Corbyn does not end up as Labour's leader"" despite voting not starting until Friday and the result not being declared until 12 September.
But others were warning about reading too much into one poll, given the difficulties of carrying out a representative survey of Labour's membership and those who have signed up as party supporters.
Joe Twyman, also from YouGov, cautioned that the poll was a snapshot and there was still ""a lot to play for"" for all of the candidates in the race.
""The ballot papers haven't gone out, we've still got a month to go. What it shows to me is that there's a lot of movement on our previous poll and there still could be a lot of movement in the remaining four weeks,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One.
A spokeswoman for Yvette Cooper's campaign said: ""This does not reflect our extensive phone banking data, which does not suggest any single candidate will receive 50% of first preferences.""
Mr Corbyn told BBC Radio London his campaign was going ""very well"" but added: ""We should be a little bit cautious.""
""There is still time for people to register as supporters and no ballot papers have been sent out yet"", the Islington North MP added.
Asked about Mr Campbell's criticism, he said the leadership contest was ""very democratic"".
He said the large number of new Labour Party members was a ""good thing"", adding: ""If they choose somebody, the leader that others don't like, well I think we have to accept the democratic process.""
But he described ""Corbynmania"" as a ""bit embarrassing"".
Former Labour Welsh Secretary Peter Hain told the World at One he did not think Mr Corbyn would make a successful party leader, or lead Labour to victory in 2020 ""unless there is some kind of major seismic change in British politics"".
But he said the choice of candidates on offer was ""underwhelming"", saying that Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper,  who he described as ""the most credible candidates"", had failed to capture ""the mood in the party"".
At-a-glance profiles of the four contenders
Mr Campbell said on his blog that he thought Mr Corbyn was ""an OK guy, a good MP, and his stance clearly chimes with many people's views of anti-austerity"" but his ability to lead and hold the party together ""is likely to be low"".
He added: ""Once the pressures of real, difficult decisions and the day to day leadership of the main opposition kick in, I fear that activists currently cashing in on perceived 'betrayal' by past Labour leaders are going to end up feeling very badly let down.""
Mr Campbell was criticised by left wing Labour MP and former leadership hopeful Diane Abbott, with the two clashing on Twitter about Labour's record.
On Monday Barry Sheerman became the latest Labour MP to call for the leadership contest to be ""paused"" over fears it had been infiltrated by supporters of other parties.

The vandalism was discovered on Wednesday, and the work is currently being cleaned.
Kapoor called the incident ""a tragedy"".
Speaking to Le Figero, he said the vandals represented ""a small fraction of people who have been told that any creative act is an endangerment of a sacred past, revered to the extreme.""
The installation, called Dirty Corner, sits in the grounds outside the palace, the home of Marie Antoinette, the 18th Century queen of France.
He stressed to the newspaper he had never used the word ""queen"" to refer to the subject of the sculpture, and claimed he had been mis-quoted.
Kapoor was originally quoted in a French interview saying the work signified ""the vagina of the queen coming into power"" - but later said the work was open to interpretation.
""Inevitably, one comes across the body, our bodies and a certain level of sexuality. But it is certainly not the only thing it is about,"" he said.
In a statement, the artist added: I am aware of the power of art and its ability to offend.  Dirty Corner is in some ways itself an act of artistic violence.

35214514,"The tourists closed on 317-5 and, with a lot of batting to come against an inexperienced South African attack, they could still get a total that takes the home side out of the game.
However, if they do, they will have done it the hard way, because the first-day performance with the bat was below their best, with too many players getting in, then getting out.
All the talk surrounding England after their convincing win in the first Test concerned the prospect of them finding some consistency, particularly with the bat. Could they nail another good performance to put this series out of South Africa's reach?
On this first day in Cape Town, they had the opportunity to do just that after winning the toss and batting first in ideal conditions on a good pitch.
But too many of the top order - Alastair Cook, Alex Hales, Nick Compton and Joe Root - did the hard part and then got out.
England want to play freely and busily, they want to be ticking along and that is a fair enough approach.
But allied to that is the need to build a careful platform, especially when so many things are in your favour. In these conditions, four wickets down at the close would have been about right, so it can be argued that England lost one too many.
That they ended the day with the upper hand was thanks to Stokes who, after a relatively lean spell, once again showed what a fine cricketer he is with an unbeaten 74.
The Durham man is a proper all-rounder, always ready to contribute with bat and ball. If one part of his game isn't firing, then he will probably deliver with the other. On top of that, he is a brilliant fielder.
Stokes is a fierce competitor and he further demonstrated that in the way he shredded the second new ball late in the day.
South Africa had built up to that point, putting all their eggs in one basket in the hope that more wickets would come. For Stokes to then smash the ball around must have been pretty deflating.
Yes, he took a chance, but he also created his own luck. He forced South Africa to remove their catchers and go on the defensive.
It is performances like this that show Stokes to be a rarity in the world game. It's hard to think of many Test sides that have a genuine all-rounder in their ranks - Australia's Mitchell Marsh and Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews are the only others that come to mind.
That dearth of all-rounders shows just how lucky England are to have Stokes at their disposal.
While Stokes has his career up and running, Hales is a man who is looking to do just that.
After he made his debut in the first Test in Durban, I spoke of his need to learn from his mistakes, namely a waft outside off stump and a needless big shot.
He did to some extent, making a maiden Test half-century, but there was some more uncertainty in the off-stump area.
South Africa captain Hashim Amla got it quite wrong, opting for a deep square leg instead of a third catcher in the slips, especially when Hales was edging his way through the 40s.
If I was an opposing captain, I'd use a packed off-side field to Hales and ask my bowlers to bowl a foot wide, because he will go for the ball eventually.
That being said, he's got promise because he does hit the ball so well. He has played some wonderful innings in limited-overs cricket and he deserves credit for his effort here, where he got through the first session, made 60, then was pretty blameless in edging a good delivery from Morne Morkel.
Yes, Hales has the potential to get out in frustrating ways, but he could also be very destructive for England if he finds his feet at Test level. He should be judged after this series.
The mistakes against Hales were not the only time that Amla was guilty, with the South Africa skipper again just letting things happen, allowing the game to drift.
That being said, he does have an inexperienced attack to work with, but pace bowler Kagiso Rabada impressed in only his fourth match, taking 3-74, including two wickets in two balls.
The 20-year-old has a nice action, bowls with decent pace and could be even quicker if he uses his left arm more.
It was the pace bowlers who shared the five wickets for South Africa today, but the most telling delivery may have been bowled by off-spinner Dane Piedt.
Some sharp turn fooled Jonny Bairstow, who was beaten between bat and pad and fortunate not to be bowled.
That shows this is a dryish pitch that could turn more as the game wears on. The amount of runs the side batting last would feel comfortable chasing should be adjusted down accordingly.
Jonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt",England were in danger of wasting a good platform on the first day of the second Test against South Africa until Ben Stokes got going late on.
23862993,"The Office for National Statistics said there were 3.5 million such households in the UK between April and June this year, about 17.1% of all households including a working age adult.
This was down from 3.7 million, or 17.9%, a year earlier.
The highest percentage of workless households was in north-east England.
Some 23% of households including a working age adult were workless in the region. The lowest was in south-east England, where 13% of households were in this category.
Workless households are defined as homes where no-one aged from 16 to 64 is in employment. This could be because they are looking for work, or they have chosen not to work, or they are unable to work.
People may choose not to work because of family commitments, early retirement or study. They may be unable to work because of sickness or disability.
The data shows that the number of workless households in the UK dropped by 182,000 over the year.
This means that 4.9 million people aged 16 to 64 lived in workless households. The ONS said this was the first time the figure had dropped below five million since 2008.
Some 14% of all children in the UK, or 1.6 million, were living in these households. About two-thirds of them were in single-parent households.
Children's charities - Barnardo's and The Children's Society - said they welcomed the fact that the number of children living in workless households was falling.
However, a move into work did not necessarily mean a move out of poverty, they argued.
They said it was imperative for the government to reduce childcare costs for families on low incomes.
The proportion of workless households was at its highest in 1996, when comparable records began, when it stood at 20.9% in the UK. This fell steadily to 17.3% in 2006 before rising to 19.2% in 2010. It has fallen relatively sharply in the past three years.
In 2013, there were 297,000 households in which no adult has ever worked, down 43,000 on the previous year. If student households are excluded, this figure drops to 224,000.
Mark Hoban, the Minister for Employment, said: ""Helping people off benefits and into work is one of this government's top priorities, so it is good news that the number of workless households has fallen by more than 425,000 since the coalition took office.
""By reforming the welfare system to ensure that people are better off in work than on benefits, and through schemes such as the Work Programme and Youth Contract we are giving people the support they need to get a job and fulfil their aspirations of looking after themselves and their families.""
Stephen Timms, Labour's shadow employment minister, said: ""Any fall in worklessness is welcome, but the truth is Britain's unemployment crisis is far from over.
""Underemployment is at record highs, long-term unemployment is at its highest level for 17 years, the number of young people out of work is edging back towards a million, and millions are working harder for less. It is becoming harder and harder for millions to make ends meet.""","The proportion of UK households where no adult aged 16 to 64 is in work is at its lowest since comparable records began in 1996, official figures show."

He was then given a regular slot on ITV variety show The Wheeltappers And Shunters Social Club, hosted by the late comedian Bernard Manning.
He made the move to the BBC in 1979 and launched The Paul Daniels Magic Show, which ran for 15 years.
He became one of the biggest stars on British TV, becoming known for a string of catchphrases, including the line: ""You'll like this... not a lot, but you'll like it.""
He said he had first used the line at a club in Yorkshire as a way of dealing with a heckler.
Daniels and his wife, a fellow performer and his on-stage assistant, married in 1988.
As well as numerous appearances on magic shows, Daniels has presented game shows including Wipeout and Odd One Out.
He appeared as a contestant on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing in 2010, and was the second person to be voted off in the series.
In a 2014 interview, McGee explained how, having left the Iranian national ballet where she was a soloist, she was initially unenthusiastic about working with a magician.
But she said she was converted after seeing Daniels on quiz show Blankety Blank.
""He was very funny - he took his jacket off and had a Superman T-shirt on and red knickers over his trousers. I was in hysterics.
""He still makes me laugh, all day long, even when I want to be angry,"" she said.
In recent years, the couple has toured regularly with a magic and comedy show, but a planned appearance at the Leicester Comedy Festival two days ago was cancelled at short notice, as was another date in Nottingham the following night.
Daniels' manager said all his future shows had been cancelled.
A statement said: ""We can confirm that one of our greatest magicians and entertainers of all times, Paul Daniels, has sadly been diagnosed with an incurable brain tumour.
""On behalf of Paul, Debbie and their families, we thank you for your kind concerns and support at this sad time and ask that their privacy continues to be respected. There will be no further comments at this time.""
Illusionist Dynamo, whose real name is Steven Frayne, wrote on his Instagram account: ""Just read this sad news! Sending my love and respect to Paul, Debbie and all the family! #MagicLegend"".
A tweet was also published on the official Dick and Dom page of children's entertainment presenters Richard McCourt and Dominic Wood, saying: ""Heartbreaking news of my true hero @ThePaulDaniels. You inspired and encouraged me to do the job I still do today. Sending strength and love.""","Magician and entertainer Paul Daniels, 77, has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, his family has said."

The haul of counterfeits included Harry Potter wands, ""Louis Vuitton"" handbags and ""Nike Air Max"" trainers.

Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill said: ""The international trade in counterfeit goods undercuts honest traders, and is linked to serious and organised crime, sweatshop working practices, child labour, and even the funding of terrorism.
""Unsuspecting customers are also left out of pocket with inferior and potentially dangerous goods.
""We are determined to crack down on this criminality and Border Force officers help protect consumers by working around the clock at ports, airports and mail sorting centres identifying and seizing counterfeit goods.""
Once seized, the force's specialist international trade team contacts the brands to discover if the goods are fake or genuine, and if they are the former, the items are destroyed.
It is then up to each brand to decide if they want to prosecute those trying to import them.
Matthew Cope, from the Intellectual Property Office, said its operations had intensified in the build up to Christmas.
""We have detained goods destined for shops and markets, proving the worth of the co-ordinated approach,"" he added. ""It is important that we have a united response and that people are protected from this type of crime.
""Anyone looking for a bargain this Christmas should be wary of prices which look too good to be true, from cut price alcohol to heavily discounted electronics, and report anything suspicious.""",Christmas shoppers are being warned to check their presents after a raft of fake goods were seized on their way into the UK.

The campaign group said PCCs were ""serial offenders"" in using ""jargon"".
Adam Simmonds, PCC, said: ""The best communicators talk to people using the type of language they understand.""
The existing chief constable, Adrian Lee, will be leaving the force in July.
The candidate information pack said the force was looking for an ""agent of change"" who can get ""client-side"" and ""is a pioneer in blue-light collaboration"".
Steve Jenner, spokesman for the Plain English Campaign, said: ""The sentence that 'our chief constable must be able to see beyond the horizons of convention to make the paradigm shift' is a prime example of 'ploddledegook'.
""Police and crime commissioners seem to be repeat offenders in this regard for their mangling of the English language and this advert is borderline criminal.
""Senior police officers are probably used to this kind of jargon so they will understand it but the danger is they use it when they talk to the public.""
The information pack also said the chief constable should not just issue ""management speak from above"" because ""inevitably such statements of corporate aspiration can feel like yet another list of jargon and management-speak"".
In response to the criticism, Mr Simmonds said: ""Anyone who knows me knows I am a straight talker, but it is a fact, highlighted by the Plain English Society, that senior police officers have to understand the type of language used in the advert.
""What I want from our next chief constable [is] someone who can talk to politicians and judges as easily as they can their own staff and members of the public.""

Leading English fancy Cue Card fell with three fences to go.
Later, Olympic cycling champion Victoria Pendleton finished fifth in the Foxhunter Chase on Pacha Du Polder.
Pendleton gave her mount a patient ride at the rear of the field, before moving through nicely and staying on strongly, but Nina Carberry was too good in front, winning on the 13-8 favourite On The Fringe by a neck for back-to-back wins in the race.
It made it another success for the Irish on a day when Don Cossack showed his strength in the feature race, winning by four and a half lengths.
It was a first Gold Cup for Elliott, who won the Grand National in 2007 with Silver Birch, and for Cooper.
The 23-year-old jockey from Kerry had a dilemma over which horse to ride with both Don Cossack and Don Poli owned by airline boss Michael O'Leary's Gigginstown House Stud, for whom Cooper is the retained rider.
His decision to opt for the nine-year-old, who recovered from a fall in the King George at Kempton on Boxing Day to win at Thurles in January, paid dividends and afterwards he paid tribute to the late trainer Dessie Hughes with whom he started his career.
""Fair play to Gordon, he stuck by me. I had the hardest decision and he had him right for today. He never missed a beat,"" said Cooper.

The 9-2 favourite Ivanovich Gorbatov gave Aidan O'Brien his first Festival winner since Istabraq's third Champion Hurdle win in 2000 when he stormed home in the JCB Triumph Hurdle.
With O'Brien concentrating on the Flat, it is his son Joseph - recently retired from riding - who supervised the hurdler's preparation as he prepares to get his full training licence.
The win for the JP McManus-owned 9-2 favourite gave jockey Barry Geraghty his first success of the week, with Willie Mullins training the second and third in Apple's Jade and Footpad.
O'Brien Jr, who won two Epsom Derbies as well as the 2000 Guineas and St Leger in his riding career, said: ""It's unbelievable. I don't think it's sunk in yet. It's very hard to put into words what I'm thinking right now.
""It's hard to compare [to winning the Derby] but it's right up there.""
Elsewhere, two former assistants to Paul Nicholls, Dan Skelton and Harry Fry, both enjoyed success while Nicholls himself claimed a final-day double.
It was a family affair for Skelton as younger brother Harry rode Superb Story (8-1) to victory in the Vincent O'Brien County Handicap Hurdle to give them their first Festival success, watched by their father Nick, who won equestrian gold at London 2012.
""I'm so delighted for them, they work really hard,"" said their proud dad. ""Harry's been saying for two weeks this horse would win. Everything worked out. I thought he'd committed too early, but he knew what he had underneath.""
Fry won his third Festival race when Unowhatimeanharry (11-1) took the Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle under Noel Fehily, overhauling long-time leader Barters Hill after jumping the last.
Nicholls, who had a relatively quiet Festival by his standards, finished on a high, winning the last two races on the card.
Ibis Du Rheu (14-1) stayed on well for Jack Sherwood to deny Flying Angel in a close finish to the Martin Pipe Conditional Jockeys' Handicap Hurdle, while the 28-1 chance Solar Impulse was the biggest-priced winner of the week, claiming the Johnny Henderson Grand Annual Chase Challenge Cup

Now the 34-year-old former boxer, who has won all 10 of her UFC fights, is preparing to defend her title against Miesha Tate at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Saturday.

""I don't want to create my whole career and life in one moment,"" Holm, nicknamed the Preacher's Daughter, told the BBC World Service.
""There's a lot weighing on this fight, there's a ton of emotional stresses. In a lot of ways, it's tougher for me. People have high expectations after the last fight.""
American Tate, the number two ranked bantamweight, has won her last four fights in the octagon but has been beaten twice by Rousey.
The 29-year-old's last loss came against the former champion in 2013 when she submitted in 58 seconds.
""She's really good at grinding it out,"" said Holm of Tate, a wrestling specialist. ""She can be behind in a fight and she is not mentally broken.
""She is coming out of a two-year winning streak. She has had way more time in the octagon than me, a lot more fighting, so there's a lot of things that present a threat to me.""
UFC's co-owner Lorenzo Fertitta told the BBC World Service that he believes mixed martial arts will eventually become an Olympic sport.
It is an idea backed by Holm, a former professional boxing champion.
""Why not? The Olympics, to me, is seeing the best that every country has to offer,"" he said.
""I hope they let it be professional fighters. A lot of the other sports in the Olympics are professional. I say let it be. How awesome would it be to be in the Olympics?""
Author and newspaper columnist Matthew Syed recently wrote in the Times that he felt ""unease"" at the sport's ""no-holds-barred nature.""
He added: ""I do wonder about the way this slickly marketed activity legitimises the basest instincts of the human psyche, and celebrates bloodshed. The sooner it falls out of favour, the better.""
But Holm dismisses claims the sport is too brutal, insisting the critics have the wrong view.
""Sometimes I think they look at this sport and see it as two caged people going crazy,"" she said.
""That's not it at all. It's two people chasing a common goal, chasing a dream.""
She added: ""You can't be the champion without another fighter, you can't get through without the other person.
""It's not like you pick on someone from the street. They both sign a contract, train very hard and are really reaching for greatness. There's nothing brutal about that, it's beautiful.""
Holm, who was also a kickboxing champion before making her mixed martial arts debut in 2011, says it requires ""passion"" to make it to the top and there is not much money when you start out.
""You're starting in amateur shows, putting money out of your own pocket to learn the sport,"" said Holm, who defeated Rousey in front of a UFC record crowd of 56,214 in Melbourne, Australia.
""If there are females in there doing it professionally, let me tell you they've been working their butts off for a lot of years.""
""If that opportunity comes, then yeah,"" says Holm.
""I'm all about taking each opportunity and making the best of it. I only think about one fight at a time.""","Ultimate Fighting Championship bantamweight champion Holly Holm says she does not want to be known as a ""one-hit wonder""."

Mr Lewis said he was ""75% hopeful"" Mr Corbyn could lead Labour to victory at the next general election.
And he said he was ""greatly"" annoyed by ""mischievous"" speculation about his leadership ambitions.
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, the Norwich South MP - who quit the shadow cabinet last month rather than vote in favour of the government's Brexit bill - said it was ""flattering"" to be ""touted as a future leader"".
It was ""possible"" that some figures close to Mr Corbyn could be behind the speculation, he said.
Pressed on whether he wanted to ever lead Labour, he said: ""Never say never, I will say that. But at this moment in time we have a twice democratically elected leader, Jeremy Corbyn.
""I'm still supportive of Jeremy Corbyn. I will be doing all I can along with the rest of my colleagues in the Labour Party to varying degrees to make sure that he becomes the next prime minister of this country.
""There is no ifs, no buts. That's where I am.""
Asked how confident he was on a scale of one to 100 that Mr Corbyn could lead Labour to a general election victory in 2020, he replied: ""I would say I'm 75% hopeful it can happen.
""Given ... the situation we find ourselves with Brexit - the chaotic situation - it's constantly moving. It would be a challenge for any leader I think.""
The Labour leadership came in for renewed criticism after the party lost the seat of Copeland to the Conservatives in last month's by-election.
It was the first by-election gain by a governing party since 1982.
Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Corbyn would lead Labour into the 2020 general election.
""Of course we are building up a succession for the long term future and we have got some really great young talent coming through but they need more experience before eventually they will succeed,"" he added.
Mr McDonnell also categorically ruled himself out of a future run for the leadership.
Asked about his claim of a ""soft coup"" against Mr Corbyn, he said a ""number of people"" within the party had been ""stirring"" ahead of the by-elections in Copeland and Stoke Central.
But he said he planned to ""have a cup of tea"" with arch critic Lord Mandelson.

But I think the most important thing that we have got is a responsibility to our party but more importantly to the country,"" he said.","A Labour MP who quit the frontbench to rebel over Brexit says he will ""keep the option open"" of one day running for leader."

After the restart Duport scored in the corner as Catalans took a 10-8 lead.
But Burgess put Wigan back ahead and further tries by Williams and Sam Tomkins followed by another Burgess effort saw Wigan home.
The Warriors move up to seventh, four points clear of ninth-placed Warrington with two games remaining before the Super 8s. And they are now four points behind fourth-placed Hull - and the top four spot that would give them the chance to defend their title.
Catalans are 10th, four points behind Huddersfield, who are eighth.
A Wigan win or any sorts looked in doubt when Duport collected a last-tackle kick to go over, with Luke Walsh adding the two points to give the French side their two-point advantage.
But Wigan, who were without coach Shaun Wane as he recovers after a hip operation, then dominated.
A brilliant team try ended with Burgess going over in the corner and Williams skipped through to give them a 10-point lead.
A Tony Gigot error then gifted Tomkins the away side's fourth try and the Burgess treble came when he went over from close range.
Catalans head coach Steve McNamara: ""For 60 to 65 minutes, there was not a lot to choose between the two teams - in fact I think we were two tries to one up.
""It was really pleasing that we were in that contest but really disappointed with the last 15 minutes. I don't think we deserved that scoreline.
""Having said that, if you give Wigan those opportunities they'll take them and that's what they did. I think that our performance today was a whole lot better than our win over Leigh last weekend.
""We can take a lot of positives out of that and hopefully we can improve next week as much as we have this week going into next week's game against St Helens.""
Wigan assistant John Winder: ""I was really pleased with the result. For 60 minutes I thought it was a real arm wrestle and it was a really tough game.
""Both sides were very competitive. We just stuck at it and got through that 60-minute mark and things just started to open up for us.
""I thought we got what we deserved and we stuck with the process long enough and we managed to snag a couple of tries before the momentum went with us at the end.

17514394,"This comes after a public outcry following revelations in November that a neo-Nazi cell had apparently been able to go on a nationwide spree of racially motivated murders over several years, under the noses of the German intelligence services.
The group of three are being held responsible for the deaths of eight Turkish and one Greek immigrant between 2000 and 2006, as well as a German policewoman in 2007.
Yet the existence of the group, dubbed the Zwickau cell after the name of the town where they spent most of their time in hiding, only came to light in November when two of its members died in an apparent joint suicide or murder-suicide and the third handed herself in to the authorities.
The NPD has been linked to the group, though the allegations have yet to be accepted in a court of law.
The trio had made a DVD in which they boasted of the killings and said they had acted to serve the German nation and its people, describing themselves as the National Socialist Underground - echoing the national socialism (Nazism) of Hitler's Germany.
The story of the killers has dominated headlines in Germany for months now and given rise to one of the biggest scandals in post-war Germany.
It turns out intelligence agencies had had the group under surveillance for years, and even found a bomb-making factory in their garage back in 1998.
So why were the trio not stopped earlier? Why were they allowed to disappear and then stay underground? And why was it that security services blamed the murders on the Turkish mafia at the time? A right-wing motive was never investigated.
The failures have prompted some to ask whether there is more than incompetence to blame, whether Germany's police and security services contain elements sympathetic to the far right - an accusation the institutions vehemently deny.
A parliamentary inquiry is currently under way into their activities, and Newsnight has seen a secret internal report revealing serious blunders by law enforcement agencies.
When we spoke to Peter Altmaier, a senior official in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat party, he admitted that mistakes had been made:
""You have to know Germany is a federal state, and competencies are shared and divided between federal and state levels... and because we have drawn the lessons from the Nazi dictatorship, we have very limited powers of police and security institutions.
""There have been hints and indications of right-wing extremism that were not taken seriously enough, and therefore we have put this very high on the political agenda.""
Another question that now worries many Germans is just how big a threat the far right poses.
Human rights groups say more than 180 people have been killed in right-wing attacks in Germany over the last 20 years.
Neo-Nazis have murdered more people in post-war Germany than any other single group, including Islamists and the far left. But this is not yet reflected in official data.
Could it be that Germany's sensitivity to its history has made it want to play down modern-day right wing extremism?
""Martin"", a former neo-Nazi leader who asked to be quoted anonymously for fear of revenge attacks, was an active member of the far right for 11 years. He has now left the movement and encourages others to do so through an organisation called Exit.
Martin told us the revelations about the Zwickau cell should have come as no surprise to the authorities:
""The militant scene has always said we need people who are willing and able and trained in case it comes to civil war, and neo-Nazi propaganda always talks about civil war. The scene is armed. It's military.
""Weapons training is carried out in secret. In the Arab world, for example, with freedom movements there. The right-wing scene sees itself as a freedom movement.""
There is a growing collection of secretive far-right groups in Germany which call themselves the ""Free Forces"".
Intelligence services say this is the fastest-spreading section of Germany's far-right movement.
They say the cliche of the neo-Nazi being a boot-wearing, young, unemployed male skinhead is out of date. Nowadays you cannot always tell who is a neo-Nazi and who is not.
The Free Forces are attracting a new crowd, including students and middle-class professionals. Germans speak of a new generation of Kravattennazis, literally ""Tie Nazis"", as opposed to the traditional Stiefelnazis, or ""Boot Nazis"".
They use modern forms of protest and are harnessing social media.
Take The Immortals, for example - anti-globalisation, anti-capitalist and anti-democratic, they warn of the impending extinction of the German people and call for a Germany for the Germans.
Hard for the authorities to catch, they use text messaging to organise spontaneous night-time demonstrations across the country, especially in university towns.
The protesters wear black cloaks and white masks, reminiscent of the hacker-anarchists Anonymous, to hide their identity. After 15 minutes on the street, they are gone.
""The leadership is always trying to attract members of the so-called upper classes and students who, one day, can act as lawyers or doctors for the far right,"" Martin explained.
""It's all done very quietly, out of the public eye. You would never imagine that some of those people would support the movement and they may deny their affiliation in public, but they are very much part of the scene.""
""You can't describe the far right as a fringe group any more. All parts of German society are found in it.""
But what exactly do they want?
Far-right activists are camera-shy. They say they are hounded by police and hemmed in by post-war German laws which make it illegal to question the Holocaust and demonstrate public appreciation of Nazi Germany, leading to a number of far-right groups being shut down and their members prosecuted.
We visited Berlin's best-known neo-Nazi pub, The Executioner, to see if we could tempt the punters there to talk.
Most people in the dimly lit, windowless establishment eyed us with suspicion and distaste, but after a couple of ""Himla'' cocktails, Uwe Dreisch, the former head of a now-banned neo-Nazi group, sat down with us and said:
""Who are we? We are nationalists. We care deeply about our fatherland. We don't like the state that exists here right now in Germany. We want to rebuild our country for our citizens, the German people.
""We want to protect our culture, our country, our religion. In Britain, you're also proud of your country, but here I, as a German, am a second-class citizen. This is because we live with eternal war guilt here in Germany. Others get preferential treatment, not us Germans.
""Those outside here who say this pub is full of evil Nazis, how would they know? They're afraid to talk to us. They just try to ban us.""
What many lawmakers in Germany say they do not like is that the far right rejects the German constitution and the Federal German Republic.
Supporters of the far right want a new order in Germany, but while they live under the current system, some are establishing what they call ""national liberated zones"", dotted across the country.
The most famous example is Jamel, a village in northern Germany which has been largely taken over by the far right.
In the middle of the village is a brightly painted Nazi-style mural in which a traditionally dressed German mother cradles her baby, surrounded by her other children.
Also painted there is a proclamation that Jamel is free, social and national.
We spoke to Udo Pastoers, number two in the NPD, the legal political wing of the far right, and the leader of the party's elected representatives in the regional parliament of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the area in which Jamel sits.
Mr Pastoers was keen to discuss the NPD's current campaign calling for more indigenous Germans to have children.
He showed me a campaign poster emblazoned with the phrase ""German children need our country. Stop the German people dying out"" in which two beautiful blonde parents frolic at a sandy water's edge with their blonde and beaming children.
Mr Pastoers said the birth-rate in Germany was far too low and that women should ""reproduce"" more, so that Germany could still deserve the name Germany.
""Imagine a country called Germany that is filled only with Africans, Arabs, Asians. Biology is our priority,"" he said.
The NPD does not do very well in the polls. Still, it has elected representatives in two of out of Germany's 16 regional parliaments.
Mr Pastoers told us the party was virtually gagged by the German authorities. If they really could speak openly, he said, a huge chunk of the German electorate would support them.
The NPD insists the stigma of being associated with the far right in modern Germany means that people who would like to vote for it do not dare to.
In an attempt to boost its numbers, the party is currently concentrating on social issues, taking advantage of widespread unease caused by the global economic crisis.
They and the wider far-right movement run youth centres and football clubs, and offer welfare advice and family outings for those short of cash.

21626428,"At a news conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Mr Kerry said the two Nato allies shared a common goal - to end the suffering of innocent civilians in Syria.
Turkey and the US both oppose Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but differ on how best to support the opposition.
The visit has been overshadowed by the Turkish PM's remarks about Zionism.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier this week called Zionism a ""crime against humanity"" - remarks that have been widely condemned, and which Mr Kerry on Friday called  ""objectionable"".
On the subject of Syria, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon said on Friday he was ""personally pained and distraught"" by the ongoing violence and suffering of civilians.
He said there was a ""very small window of opportunity"" for the Syrian government and the opposition to hold talks, and admitted that, for the UN, there was ""not much political space"".
Mr Ban went on to say that, in his opinion, the only thing for the moment was to increase humanitarian assistance but it was ""almost impossible"" for aid agencies to provide enough relief, as they were continually ""outpaced"" by the need.
The crisis in Syria has been a central issue in John Kerry's first overseas trip as secretary of state, which is taking him to 11 countries in Europe and the Middle East.
He said in Ankara that the US and Turkey ""both believe the first priority is to try and have a political solution. We would like to save lives, not see them caught up in a continuing war"".
Mr Davutoglu said their main objective was to ""protect the innocent civilians of Syria"".
In Rome on Thursday, Mr Kerry promised direct aid to Syrian rebels in the form of food and medical supplies, but not the weapons they say they need to win.
Turkey has taken in more than 200,000 Syrian refugees and has been hit by deadly shelling across its 900km (560 mile) border with Syria.
Turkey wants the Syrian rebels to win the war as soon as possible and will be keen to convey its sense of frustration to Mr Kerry, the BBC's James Reynolds in Istanbul says.
The US and other Nato allies have deployed Patriot missile interceptors to repel any possible attack by missiles or aircraft from Syria.
Mr Erdogan has been outspoken in his support for Syrian rebels and has advocated the creation of a buffer zone inside northern Syria to protect people fleeing the fighting.
Turkey began massing troops along the frontier in June last year after Syria shot down a Turkish reconnaissance jet off its coast.
In October the Turkish army fired on military targets in Syria in retaliation for cross-border mortar fire.
The rebel Free Syrian Army is thought to receive weapons and other supplies from Turkey.
The US has refrained from arming the rebels, in part because of concerns the weapons could eventually fall into the hands of Islamist militants who might attack its interests.
On Thursday in Rome, Mr Kerry promised an additional $60m (Â£40m) in aid to the opposition Syrian National Coalition to help it deliver basic governance and other services in rebel-controlled areas.
He also promised direct support in the form of food and medical supplies to rebel forces, in what correspondents say was a shift in US policy on Syria.
Russia - a close ally of President Assad - has said the promises of aid to the opposition made by the US and other countries in the ""Friends of Syria"" group will encourage further violence rather than a negotiated solution.
""The decisions taken in Rome... directly encourage extremists towards precisely a violent seizure of power, despite the suffering of ordinary Syrians,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Lukashevich said.",New US Secretary of State John Kerry has been holding talks with his Turkish counterpart on the conflict in Syria.

Arsenal were 4-0 down but took the game to extra-time, with a Theo Walcott hat-trick and two Marouane Chamakh goals helping them into the last eight.
""We went from disaster to rescuing some pride,"" Wenger said. ""You cannot play for Arsenal and give up.""
Reading boss Brian McDermott said the defeat was the ""worst"" of his career.
Arsenal found themselves 4-0 down after 35 minutes but Walcott made it 4-1 just before half-time to set up the platform for an incredible second-half revival that took the game into extra time.
Chamakh put Arsenal in front for the first time on the night with a goal in the first period of extra time, only for Reading striker Pavel Pogrebnyak to make it 5-5. But Walcott restored Arsenal's lead before Chamakh scored their seventh.
""It was 4-0 and could have been one or two more,"" Wenger added. ""We came back but at 89 minutes it was still 4-2. Then the miracle happened. There were so many turning points. Our first goal before half-time was important. It's my first 7-5. It was a tennis score.""
Wenger said he knew the pain of relinquishing a four-goal advantage, having drawn 4-4 with Newcastle after being 4-0 up in February 2011. He explained that his team had drawn inspiration from their supporters.
He said: ""I know how it feels to lose a 4-0 lead - it happened to me at Newcastle. I always hoped we could come back. It's strange to explain. At 4-0 you think you have won the game, but at 4-2 the panic starts to set in.

""This was maybe my greatest comeback. [The League Cup] is not my priority but had we gone out like we could have gone out it would not have been one of my proudest nights.""
Reading boss Brian McDermott described the defeat as the worst of his career and identified Arsenal's first goal before half-time as the turning point.
""I wasn't happy at half-time because we went in at 4-1 instead of 4-0,"" he said.
""That gave them impetus they didn't need. We'd dominated the first half and then they scored a goal out of nothing.
""When you give good players and teams a lift like that, they take the chance. It was kamikaze football in the second half and extra time. Even at 5-5 it's extraordinary. It's the worst defeat of my career.""
McDermott was angry that Walcott's equalising goal arrived almost two minutes after the minimum four minutes of stoppage-time had been played.
""Obviously it doesn't help that the referee added two minutes on to the four minutes of injury time to make it six,"" he said. ""You can't tell the time as wrong as that, but he did.

""I hope that things will change after my comments - this is the most important thing,"" said Broos, who won the Africa Cup of Nations last month in spite of having worked on the continent for just a year.
""Sometimes you have to make the problem bigger than it is so that everyone is awake and says 'what happened there?'""

After the match in Brussels, the Cameroon coach said he was 'seriously considering' his future as he also outlined various logistical failures since he took charge in early 2016.
He highlighted that team doctors had sometimes footed the costs for medical equipment themselves while also relating how the team had once had to travel without equipment or kit because it was too expensive to fly.
""It's unacceptable that when players are going to eat something, the hotel tells us that we cannot eat because the bill has not been paid,"" he said.
""Three to four hours after the hotel (took their action), the bill was paid so it's not a matter of money - it's a matter of organisation and responsibility.""
In the run-up to this year's unexpected African title, the fifth in Cameroon's history, at least seven internationals refused call-ups for the tournament.

39325536,"But being an editor isn't just an editorial job.
The editorial side of it is the most fulfilling and intellectually stimulating part, but it is only a part.
There are also huge commercial responsibilities - how do we make money and save money? - and leadership and management duties.
Leadership is about creating a moral vision for where you want to take a team; management is the daily activity of getting them there.
It has always seemed to me that in rich newspapers, the editor gets to focus on editing, while other people think about the commercial and managerial side of it.
For instance, the Daily Mail has several busy managing editors, whereas the Evening Standard has only one.
George Osborne to become Standard editor
Osborne Evening Standard job prompts call for inquiry
George Osborne: From history buff to austerity editor
Read more from Amol
At organisations that are strapped for cash - and the Standard is facing big commercial challenges - editors have to spend relatively more of their time thinking about commercial and managerial obligations.
And all of that is hugely time consuming. It leaves less time than you would like for the really exciting bit: editing.
Editing is an exercise in selection and judgement: what to put in and - just as important - what to leave out.
Which pictures, campaigns, and above all stories to run? What's the best headline on that front page splash? Shall we give this or that person a kicking in the sports pages? And should our cartoonist really depict Nigel Farage as an amphibian yet again?
When making these decisions, based on your judgement, which is in turn informed by your values and experience, an editor has three sacred loyalties - in my view, in no particular order.
First, to the truth; second, to the reader; and third, to the integrity and reputation of the newspaper.
Some would argue that there are other loyalties.
An editor of The Catholic Herald might think they had a duty to God, for instance; an editor of Country Life might feel they had a duty to England's enchanted land; and all editors are likely to feel a duty to those paying the bills.
But those earlier loyalties are supreme.
They are very different to the loyalties required by political parties.
I have never been a member of a political party, but I suspect those who have would say their loyalties aren't primarily to truth, readers, or newspaper reputations.
A political party is an institution that organises its members to acquire and exercise legislative power.
Its members have loyalty above all to that task. If they are committed, they wake up every day thirsting for power.
Once they have acquired it, fidelity to their tribe makes them determined not to relinquish it.
Quite aside from the sheer practical workload, it is not easy to see how the loyalties required by editorship and the loyalties required by membership of a political party can be reconciled.
The latter long to inhabit the corridors of power. The former want to throw grenades at it.
Journalism, at its best, is about the ferocious scrutiny of power.
That requires a certain distance from it. Of course, there are different types of journalism.
I can see how it might be feasible for a theatre critic to be group secretary of his local Socialist Workers Party.
I can also see how a brilliant football correspondent could be a member of the neo-Nazis.
But an editor, who has to conduct daily combat with politicians?
In being a member of the Conservative Party and, soon, editor of the London Evening Standard, George Osborne faces both practical and philosophical problems.
The practical one is when to sleep. The philosophical one is how to reconcile his clearly divided loyalties.
Which of his constituents matter most - those in Tatton, or his near-million readers at the Standard?
How does he cover, say, a Budget: as a loyal Conservative MP, or as a fearless editor?
It is hard enough to see how you reconcile being a member of a political party with being a journalist, let alone being an editor.
However, being not only a member of a political party, but a sitting MP and a recent chancellor, as well as someone who retains political ambitions, is much tougher still.
And that's before we even consider BlackRock. How can you cover the world of asset management while being paid Â£650,000 by it?
The idea that Mr Osborne could recuse himself from stories about that industry, or indeed the City pages altogether, strikes me as sub-optimal, to put it mildly: it would be bizarre to have a former chancellor as editor, only for him to have no involvement in business coverage.
These conflicts of interest are untenable, and so - as I said on Friday - I can't see it lasting.
Given his sources of income, he's much likelier to give up being an MP before he gives up having lunch at BlackRock.
Whether it happens when Tatton disappears as a constituency, or before, I suspect he will be editor of the London Evening Standard after he is an MP in Cheshire.
As I mentioned in my previous posts, his task at the paper - setting out a clear strategy, improving the product, raising its profile, and turning the business around by finding new revenue streams - is one for which he has relevant experience and connections.
That said, it strikes me as a full-time job. Perhaps, therefore, Osborne hasn't fully grasped the function of an editor.
I hope this post helps.","Editing a newspaper is an extremely rewarding and tough job, probably harder these days than a few decades ago, because of scarcity of resources and the demands of the internet."

36442479,"The US, UK and France have been calling for air operations, given the reluctance of Damascus to allow relief into rebel-held areas.
This comes as Syria says it has approved the delivery of aid to 36 regions, including 11 besieged areas.
Meanwhile, air strikes in and around the northern city of Aleppo have reportedly killed 31 civilians.
They included 10 people on a bus going down a road used by rebels as a supply route, rescue workers from the Syrian Civil Defence force said.
Stephen O'Brien, the UN aid chief, told the Security Council that consent from Damascus was needed to carry out the air operations, diplomats who were in the closed door meeting said.
The formal request would be made on Sunday, they added.
The UN has 19 areas designated as ""besieged"" in the country, where an estimated 600,000 people live.
The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said it had already drawn up a plan to carry out air drops but that funding was also needed.
However, a senior UN official warned that air operations were ""not imminent"".
Earlier, a statement by the Syrian Mission to the UN said permissions for humanitarian aid included access to Kafr Batna, Saqba, Hammura, Jisrein, Zabadin, East Harasta, Zamalka, Madaya, Foua, Kefraya and Yarmouk.
Eight other towns were approved to receive medical assistance, school supplies and milk for children, including Daraya and Douma, also under siege, it said.
The Syrian opposition has warned the government may open the door just enough to alleviate international pressure before restricting access again.
In February, the WFP carried out a 21-pallet air drop of aid to a government-held area of Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria, which ended in failure. Of the 21 pallets, 10 were unaccounted for, seven landed in no-man's land and four were damaged.
But it has since carried out 44 air drops over the city, delivering mainly rice, chickpeas and beans to meet the immediate needs of around 100,000 residents.
The WFP has identified some 592,700 people in 19 besieged areas that may need to receive aid by air.
But the operating conditions are challenging, it says. Many besieged locations are in built-up, urban areas with no suitable space for a drop zone. High-altitude drops are not possible in those areas because of the risk of harming people on the ground.
The UN food agency says airdrops are always a last resort as access by land is more efficient.
Meanwhile, aircraft from the US-led coalition dropped ammunition to rebels in the town of Marea, in Aleppo province, the UK-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
It was not clear if weapons were also delivered.
Rebels are fighting militants from so-called Islamic State (IS), who cut off supply routes between Marea and Azaz, both under rebel control, near the Turkish border.
The area between the city of Aleppo and the Turkish border is split between IS, rebel and government-controlled zones.
The US is also supporting an offensive by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), made up by Kurdish and Arab fighters, against IS-held Manbij.
The Syrian Observatory also said Islamist insurgents, including from the al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front, and government forces have attacked each other near Khan Touman, in southwest Aleppo.","The United Nations will ask Syria to allow the air drop of humanitarian aid to areas under siege, diplomats say."
36487784,"Two dozen national football teams and at least two million foreign visitors will be here for the Euro 2016 football championships.
But how ready is the nation to focus on ""the beautiful game""?
This was meant to be France's feel-good moment. But like cherries that are always hanging just out of reach, the build-up to Euro 2016 has been interrupted by one distraction after another:
Having got through all of that, on the eve of the championship, France is facing fresh strikes at the national airline, and rubbish left to rot in the street as bin-men join the rolling protests over labour reforms.
It's a wonder people have any time left to think about whether Didier Deschamps has got the right men in his defence line-up for the French national side.
But it's not as if football has been entirely out of the headlines either.
Last month, Eric Cantona implied that the French coach had allowed racism to colour his selection for the squad.  That followed an earlier scandal that saw two of the country's top players embroiled in blackmail allegations - and consequently dropped from the Euro 2016 team.
So if the mood here ahead of kick-off has been, well, muted, perhaps it's no surprise.
But there is, of course, another reason for the rather subdued atmosphere ahead of the games.
When President Hollande arrives at the Stade de France in northern Paris tomorrow for the opening ceremony, it will be a poignant moment.  Many of those watching will be remembering the night he was bundled out of the stadium during another match last November, as three suicide bombers blew themselves up outside.
It was the start of France's night of terror, in which 130 people were killed on the streets of Paris. Now, the fears of police, public and politicians as they head into the tournament hang heavy in the air.
The Euros are spread between 10 French cities, each requiring its own security plans.
One hundred thousand police, soldiers and security guards have been detailed to protect the games but, as the interior minister points out, ""even 100% preparation cannot guarantee zero risk"".
A leaked police document, calling for the partial closure of vast ""fan-zones"" set up in cities including Paris and Marseille, has been widely reported in French media.
On the eve of the tournament, workers in Paris said they were planning to stay away from the zones, considered softer targets than the stadiums themselves.
""It's fun to have the Euros in France,"" said Eva, a 32-year-old jurist, ""but with everything that's happening, it could create more problems than anything else. It's fun in principle, but with the strikes for example, we're not going to see a good image of France.""
""Even though I'm not a big football fan, I'm excited by the ambiance,"" said David, a finance worker in the city.
""But the recent events are on everyone's mind and there's a lot of talk about security, so the euphoria is dampened by that.  If there is a target, it will be the Euros.""
While an attack would be devastating for the host nation, a peaceful, well-managed tournament would go a long way towards restoring a sense of security, something that has been missing here since the attacks last year.
Similarly, in terms of the social divisions and political disillusionment plaguing France, the games could turn out to be a unifying moment of national pride, or another opportunity to dissect the nation's disappointment.
Many here expect the public excitement to build as France heads into the opening game against Romania on Friday night.
Because, after all the logistical problems and all the discussion of security risks, this country is hungry for some good news, and those cherries still look sweet.
After all, the nation was divided and subdued in the days before the 1998 World Cup in France, and look how that turned out.","Seven months after a terrorist massacre in its capital city, France raises the curtain on Friday evening on one of the world's biggest sporting events."

Leeds striker Wood also saw a deflected effort hit the woodwork, when his shot was turned onto the post by Bees goalkeeper David Button.
But, just when it looked like it might turn out to be a first defeat of the season for the hosts, Brentford's debutant substitute Woods - who had only been on the pitch for two minutes - was easily dispossessed by Antenucci and the Italian, who had come on at half-time, fired home the equaliser into the corner with his left foot.

36193382,"North Yorkshire Chief Constable Dave Jones steps in following David Crompton's suspension after the jury concluded the 96 victims were unlawfully killed.
Mr Crompton's initial replacement, deputy Dawn Copley, stood down after her appointment was criticised.
Mrs Copley had been investigated over her conduct with another force.
As agreed with North Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Julia Mulligan, Mr Jones will remain in post until a permanent appointment is made, Ms Mulligan's South Yorkshire counterpart Dr Alan Billings said.
""I am confident that he will be able to move the force forward to a position where trust and confidence in the force can begin to be restored,"" said Dr Billings.
David Crompton, who was due to retire in November after four years in the post, was suspended after what Dr Billings described as ""an erosion of trust and confidence in South Yorkshire Police"".
Mr Crompton and the force have faced continuing criticism not only in relations to Hillsborough but also over its handling of investigations into child sexual exploitation.
Mr Jones began his career in Greater Manchester and was Assistant Chief Constable for Police Service Northern Ireland until moving to North Yorkshire in 2013.
He said he realised he was taking the post at a very difficult period and said he wanted to make a difference.
""First and foremost, I will engage with those communities both inside and outside of South Yorkshire who have been let down by the police service,"" Mr Jones said.
""I want to understand how their confidence in policing has been affected, and work with them to build it back up and restore pride back into the police service.""

38069609,"Kenneth Gibson and his wife Patricia - the MP for North Ayrshire and Arran - lost their baby towards the end of her pregnancy in 2009.
Staff at the Southern General hospital in Glasgow had failed to spot that Mrs Gibson had pre-eclampsia.
A review of baby deaths at Crosshouse Hospital was announced on Tuesday.
It came after a BBC Scotland investigation revealed that there had been six so-called ""unnecessary"" deaths of babies at the hospital since 2008.
""Unnecessary"" or ""avoidable"" deaths are referred to as those where harm was caused to a healthy baby during childbirth - usually resulting in them being deprived of oxygen.
Reports into some of the deaths referred to failings in monitoring of the child's heartbeat during childbirth.
Speaking in the Holyrood chamber, Mr Gibson urged Health Secretary Shona Robison to make the review ""wider and deeper"" so it could look at similar cases in other hospitals across the country.
His wife has previously opened up in the House of Commons about the ""devastating"" effect of losing her baby.
Mr Gibson said: ""On her due date in 2009, my wife Patricia, having been sent home and been physically sick, was finally admitted to the Southern General maternity unit despite their protests.
""A consultant junior doctor and two midwives examined her that day. Despite being 41, a first-time mother and in extreme pain from head to toe, no-one picked up her pre-eclampsia. She was given morphine and put to bed.
""Overnight our baby died and had to be delivered by caesarean. Patricia's liver ruptured and she spent 19 days in intensive care and high dependence.""
Mr Gibson said the couple had spent 20 months asking NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to explain how they would prevent such a failure of care reoccurring and impacting other lives.
He added: ""They blanked us and when we were thereby forced to take legal action, hired a QC, wasting thousands in taxpayers' money to defend the indefensible.
""It took five years before they eventually conceded this year. What will the Cabinet secretary do to ensure other people in Ayrshire, Glasgow and elsewhere in Scotland are not treated as badly when they experience such a tragedy?""
Ms Robison said she sympathised with the Gibsons' ""appalling"" experience, adding: ""We would expect all health professionals to treat anyone who has suffered any bereavement with care, dignity and respect.
""Clearly that didn't happen in that case and we should learn the lessons from that case.""
Labour MSP Anas Sarwar raised figures from the BBC investigation, which showed that Scotland's maternity hospitals had recorded more than 25,000 adverse incidents since 2011.
The figures, released under freedom of information legislation, showed the most serious incidents included the deaths of 26 newborns and three mothers, as well as 79 stillbirths.
Mr Sarwar called for the review to be extended to look at staffing across all maternity units in Scotland, highlighting 500 incidents relating to staff shortages.
The health secretary responded by saying NHS Scotland met the Royal College Of Midwives' recommended midwife-to-birth ratio, and patient safety programmes had resulted in the lowest levels of stillbirth and neonatal deaths on record as well as a decrease in maternal deaths.
She added: ""In those really, really significant adverse events, the worst kind, we have seen huge progress being made through that patient safety programme so that it is fair to say that our maternity and neonatal units are safer now than they were four or five years ago.""",An SNP MSP has spoken about the loss of his child as he urged Scotland's health secretary to widen a review into baby deaths at a Kilmarnock hospital.

31657929,"Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was sentenced for attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one of having sex with a girl under 13.
Sentencing, Judge Alistair McCreath said he could find ""no real evidence"" that Gadd had atoned for his crimes.
The 70-year-old showed no emotion as he left the dock at Southwark Crown Court.
Judge McCreath told Gadd it was clear his victims ""were all profoundly affected"" by his abuse of them.
""You did all of them real and lasting damage and you did so for no other reason than to obtain sexual gratification for yourself of a wholly improper kind,"" he said.
Judge McCreath said he assessed the seriousness of the offences by current guidelines, but he was limited to the maximum sentences that were available at the time the offences were committed, when ""the sentencing climate was less severe"".
""The offences for which I must pass sentence today took place many years ago at a time when in particular, in respect of one of them, the maximum sentence was considerably lower than that which is now available,"" he said.
Judge McCreath said the modern equivalent offence of unlawful intercourse with a child under 13 would be equivalent to rape of a child, but said he was not permitted to pass a life sentence.
He said the offence of attempted rape was ""so serious"" as to justify the maximum available sentence under the old regime of seven years, which he noted would be a lenient sentence under modern guidelines.
Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC, defending, told the court that Gadd had been subject to a ""very high degree of vilification"" and ""demonification"" in the press after being jailed in Vietnam in 2006 for molesting two girls aged 11 and 12.
She said he had led ""an increasingly isolated life"" for the last decade and had been unable to walk down the street ""without being the subject of vilification"".
Gadd, from Marylebone, central London, had denied the allegations against him but was found guilty at the end of a three-week-long trial earlier this month.
He had been at the height of his fame when he attacked two girls aged 12 and 13 after inviting them backstage to his dressing room.
His youngest victim had been less than 10 years old when he crept into her bed and tried to rape her in 1975.
Judge McCreath described Gadd's abuse of a girl under 10 as ""appalling"" and said: ""It is difficult to overstate the depravity of this dreadful behaviour.""
He noted that in 2011 Gadd sought professional help to understand his sexual behaviour but said: ""Whatever changes may have been effected in you by this treatment, they did not include any admission at all on your part of the wrong that you had done.""
The allegations against Gadd came to light only years later when he became the first person to be arrested under Operation Yewtree - the investigation launched by the Met in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.
Scotland Yard confirmed that it had received other information in light of Gadd's conviction, and that it is ""currently being assessed"".
Det Ch Insp Michael Orchard, from Operation Yewtree, said Gadd was a ""habitual sexual predator who took advantage of the star status afforded to him"".
He added: ""His lack of remorse and defence that the victims were lying make his crimes all the more indefensible.""
Mark Castle, chief executive of charity Victim Support, said: ""This prison sentence is testament to the courage Glitter's victims showed in reporting their ordeal and bravely confronting this serial paedophile in court.""",Former pop star Gary Glitter has been jailed for a total of 16 years for sexually abusing three young girls between 1975 and 1980.
26806116,"Currently, they can be punished only if unsolicited calls cause ""substantial damage"" to householders.
Ministers will also consult on imposing heftier fines. Some consumer groups say the measures do not go far enough.
The Information Commissioner's Office received 120,310 complaints about ""unsolicited marketing calls"" from April-November 2013.
It is illegal for companies to call domestic numbers registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS).
The Telephone Preference Service runs a register that allows people to opt out of any unsolicited sales or marketing calls.
Individuals can register free of charge by visiting the website. Or they can call 0845 070 0707. It takes 28 days for registration to become effective.
Mobile phone numbers can also be registered, although this will not prevent unsolicited text messages.
It is a legal requirement that all organisations - including charities, voluntary organisations and political parties - do not make such calls to numbers registered on the TPS unless they have the individual's consent to do so.
Telephone Preference Service
The rules do not apply when people consent to their details being used for marketing purposes.
But BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said members of the public continued to get unwanted calls - often pre-recorded - despite being registered with the TPS.
That was because not all companies were members of the Direct Marketing Association - the UK telemarketing industry body - some were overseas and some were ""good old-fashioned fraudsters"" out to steal money, he said.
The problem of unwanted calls may never be fully eradicated, he added.
Repeat offenders include firms inquiring about mis-sold payment protection insurance.
Firms which flout the TPS rules can currently be fined up to Â£500,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office.
Those which break media regulator Ofcom rules on silent and abandoned calls face fines of up to Â£2m.
Critics say the system is not working because rules on enforcement are skewed in favour of rogue firms.
Under Culture Secretary Maria Miller's plans, the current ""substantial damage"" threshold could be lowered.
They would also make it simpler for regulators such as Ofcom, the Insolvency Service and the Information Commissioner's Office to swap data about who the offenders might be.
And the Ministry of Justice will launch a consultation on Monday on whether firms that break the rules should face fines of up to 20% of their annual turnover.
""Nuisance calls must stop,"" Ms Miller said.
""At best they are an irritation and an unwanted intrusion; at worst they cause real distress and fear, particularly to the elderly or housebound.
""People need to feel safe and secure in their homes.
""The rules are clear - people have the right to choose not to receive unsolicited marketing calls. We will work to ensure their choice is respected.""
Which? executive director Richard Lloyd welcomed the plans saying he hoped regulators would now be given ""the tools to get rid of the unwanted calls that millions of us are getting bombarded with"".
""But we've got to be honest about this - some of this is firms that are operating overseas,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live.
""The companies in Britain that benefit from those calls have to be held to account for that.
""But it's not going to be possible to turn this off overnight.""
Mr Lloyd, who said a thousand complaints a week were made to Which? about nuisance callers, urged more people to register their phone number with the Telephone Preference Service.
""But it's going to be a long battle to keep these rogue companies - that really don't care about the rules - to get them under control and stop these nuisance calls and texts.""
Mike Lordan, chief executive of the Direct Marketing Association, said it was unacceptable for people to receive unsolicited phone calls at home if they were registered on the TPS and hadn't given their consent for someone to call them.
He told 5 live the regulations on calls generally covered those made from overseas.
""It affects companies that operate in the UK and, if they use overseas call centres to make calls, the law still applies to them.
""And most of these calls that are being made - these rogue calls - are being made on behalf of companies that are registered in the UK.""
He said he regretted ""some of the image"" associated with his industry but added: ""I'd like to stress that it's not our business.
""Our code of practice is very strict.""
He said the industry employed a million people, ""many of those in areas of fairly high unemployment and we want to drive these rogue companies out of this particular field of business"".
Under the new rules, claims management companies (CMCs) could also face punishment if they buy leads generated by other firms which bombard customers with unwanted cold calls.
CMCs advertise widely on TV, in newspapers and on the internet, encouraging people to sue for personal injury compensation and for other losses.
Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""The Claims Management Regulator already takes tough action against companies which break the rules, suspending and closing down rogue firms, but now these fines will give us an extra weapon to drive bad behaviour out of the industry.""
In December, the Commons Culture, Media and Sport committee said watchdogs should use their powers more often to punish misuse of phone networks and contact information.
It found that a significant cause of nuisance calls was the unfair or even illegal use of personal data.
This included obtaining a person's ""consent"" to receive unsolicited marketing calls in ways that were ""at best opaque and at worst dishonest"" and trading personal details with companies which were ""lacking in scruples"".
The Fair Telecoms campaign group said the plans did not go far enough in dealing with the distress caused by constant nuisance calls.
""Stop mucking about with arguments about what is and what isn't consent and stop giving all the power to these half-baked regulators,"" the group's David Hickson said.
In April 2013, telecoms operator TalkTalk was fined Â£750,000 by Ofcom for making an excessive number of abandoned and silent calls during a telemarketing campaign to attract new subscribers.
TalkTalk said it had terminated its relationship with two call centres used when the problem was discovered.",The government is planning to make it easier to fine firms that hound members of the public with nuisance calls.
23495026,"The largest numbers of children rescued were in San Francisco, Detroit, Milwaukee, Denver and New Orleans.
FBI assistant director Ronald Hosko said the Operation Cross Country VII raids had been the agency's largest action against child exploitation.
The FBI said 2,700 children have been rescued in such US raids since 2003.
The victims in the most recent raids were almost all girls and range in age from 13 to 17.
They had been prostituted in a variety of locations, including truck stops, casinos, motels as well as on social media and online advertisements.
Mr Hosko said the accused had preyed on vulnerable teenagers, exploiting them over a period of time.
""Girls are enticed with compliments or offers, [asked] do they want to make some money,"" he said.
""Then they are trapped into this cycle that involves drugs, that involves physical abuse. It may involve torture.""
Since 2003, some 1,350 people have been convicted in such cases, including life prison sentences for 10 pimps, the FBI said.
Assets of more than $3.1m (Â£2m) have been seized.
The US justice department has estimated as many as 450,000 children run away from home each year.
It says a third of teens living on the street will be lured toward prostitution within 48 hours of leaving home.

Kevin McShane of the Institute of Civil Engineers told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme that it was a surprise ""nothing more serious"" had happened because the foundations had moved.

35916857,"But it leaves the issue at the heart of the dispute unresolved: could the FBI have forced Apple to help it unlock the device?
It is unlikely that this will be the last time a law enforcement agency tries to compel a tech company to help bypass security measures.
It had been reported that there were about a dozen other cases in which the US Justice Department was pursuing court orders to force Apple to help its investigators.
The highest profile of these was in Brooklyn, New York, where the FBI wanted access to an iPhone belonging to a defendant who had already pleaded guilty to drug dealing.
In that case, a federal judge had rejected the DoJ's effort to invoke the All Writs Act - a three-centuries-old statute that allows court orders to be issued in circumstances where other laws don't apply.
The DoJ had launched an appeal, but it is not yet clear if it will continue or drop it. Its decision may be based on whether the technique used to extract data from Farook's handset can be used in other cases.
The New York case involved an iPhone 5S running the iOS 7 operating system, while the San Bernardino, California case was about an iPhone 5C running the more modern iOS 9. What works against one device might not work against the other.
But assuming the US government will at some point try again to use the All Writs Act to force Apple or some other tech company to circumvent its data protection measures, it may take a Supreme Court ruling to determine whether this is truly within the authorities' power.
At this point, there is nothing to compel the FBI to reveal how it was done, although Apple is likely to be pressing hard to find out.
The tech firm's lawyers have already said they would want details of the technique to be made public if evidence from the cracked iPhone is later used at trial.
But it could remain secret. There is scope within US law for the authorities to withhold the source of information if it was supplied to them on a confidential basis, and to protect sensitive intelligence-gathering methodologies.
Not necessarily.
The court order originally obtained by the FBI had instructed Apple to come up with a special version of its operating system that would have prevented Farook's iPhone from deleting its data or imposing long lockout periods if too many incorrect passcode guesses were made.
However, the latest court filings do not say that someone else has now done this, but merely that some data stored on the device has been obtained.
Researchers at the cybersecurity firm IOActive had proposed that one way of getting data off an iPhone would be to ""de-cap"" its memory chips.
The process they described involved using acid and lasers to expose and copy ID information about the device so that efforts to crack its passcode could be simulated on another computer without risk of triggering the original iPhone's self-destruct tool.
If indeed this is what happened, it is not easy and there's a high risk of causing so much damage to the phone that the desired data becomes irretrievable.
By contrast, Cellebrite - a data forensics firm that has reportedly helped the FBI with the case - has previously discussed ""bypassing"" passcode locks rather than trying to deduce the number.
But it is possible that doing this would yield access to only a limited amount of a handset's data.
One other point is that Apple recently updated its iOS software.
Each upgrade adds security fixes. So, if the FBI has indeed been alerted to a flaw in Farook's phone's security settings, that bug may no longer exist in devices that have installed iOS 9.3.
Short of destroying the device, perhaps no.
But you can use encryption-enabled apps to digitally scramble data.
The chat tool Wickr Messenger, for instance, lets you set it so that you have to enter a password each time you log back into the app.
Likewise, PQChat requires typing in a five-digit passcode of its own to get access.
So, even if a cracked iPhone did give up the contents of its text messages, emails and WhatsApp chats, the contents of the apps mentioned above should remain safe.
All this presumes, however, that the authorities do not manage to install spyware on your device. If that happens, all bets are off.
As part of her efforts to pass the Investigatory Powers Bill, the home secretary Theresa May has said that tech firms wouldn't have hand over encryption keys or build backdoors into their platforms.
But the law still makes mention of ""equipment interference warrants"".
Campaigners at the Electronic Frontier Foundation have warned that these could be used to force Apple and others to insert new code into a device in order to help the authorities extract data, in a similar manner to the FBI's earlier order.
The EFF adds that ""matching gag orders"" would prevent the firms from informing their customers or even their own lawyers about the act.
Equipment interference warrants already exist under the UK's current law.
And for now, the focus of Apple and other tech firms is getting the Investigatory Powers Bill amended to say that in the future the warrants could only be amended with the permission of a judge.
But were there to be a case where the UK police attempted to coerce Apple to override its  protective measures, it might still resist - even if the fact never became public.","The US government's declaration that it has ""successfully accessed the data stored on [San Bernardino gunman] Farook's iPhone and therefore no longer requires"" assistance from Apple, ends a six week-long legal clash between the tech firm and the FBI."
38806573,"The company reported a 21.8% increase in pre-tax profits to Â£14.5m for the year to 27 November.
Ocado chief executive Tim Steiner said it had achieved ""robust trading"" in a challenging environment.
However, the average order size fell 2.7% to Â£108.10 against the backdrop of continuing supermarket price wars.
The rise of German competitors Aldi and Lidl has shaken up the sector, putting pressure on the big four supermarkets, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons.
But investors welcomed Ocado's latest results, sending its share price up by more than 7% to 262p in morning trading.
Annual revenues rose 14.8% to Â£1.27bn, and the retailer's customer base grew by almost 14% over the year to 580,000.
However, Ocado said it was still in continued talks with several international retailers in regards to a partnership using the Ocado Smart Platform.
When it released its full-year results in February last year, Ocado said it was in ""advanced discussions with multiple potential international partners"" for the platform, adding it expected to sign ""multiple deals"" in the medium term.
Analysts believe agreements with retailers in the US and western Europe are important in driving Ocado's share price.
George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: ""The group has long said it's making progress on deals with third parties, but there hasn't been much in the way of tangible progress recently.
""The appointment of Luke Jensen [from Sainsbury's] as head of Ocado's Smart Platform will raise hopes that the group can finally get someone to sign on the dotted line.""
However, Mr Salmon warned that ""following Amazon's entry into the market, competitive pressures are rising in its core business"".
""In this context, it's arguably more important than ever for the group to get something over the line.""
Last year, Morrisons agreed to supply groceries to Amazon customers in the UK under a new deal with the US online giant.
Amazon's entry into the market was seen as escalating competition in the sector.
In August 2016, Morrisons also built on its existing relationship with Ocado expanding its home delivery service nationwide in a new deal with the online grocer.

Suspect Dylann Roof, 21, is due to make his first court appearance on Friday.
He was arrested on Thursday more than 200 miles away in North Carolina and flown back to South Carolina.
Police are treating the killings at the Emanuel AME Church on Wednesday evening as a hate crime.
Prayer vigils have been held in churches in Charleston and across the US for the six women and three men who died.
At the vigil for victim Sharonda Singleton, her teenage children told the BBC they had forgiven her killer and wanted to focus on moving on in a positive way.
""We already forgive him for what he's done,"" said her son, Chris.
""And there's nothing but love from our side of the family. Love is stronger than hate.""
Churches in Charleston were full to overflowing on Thursday evening as prayer services were held. Some services were held outdoors.
Hundreds gathered outside the Emanuel AME Church to pay tribute.
Governor Haley told NBC's Today show that South Carolina had been ""hurt"" by the deaths of nine innocent people.
She said she wanted the suspect tried on state charges in South Carolina rather than federal charges.
Mr Roof is due to appear in court via video link for a bail hearing on Friday. He is being held at a detention centre in the Charleston area, the county sheriff's office said.
He was detained on Thursday after police acting on a tip-off stopped his car in Shelby, North Carolina.
Police had earlier released CCTV images of the suspect and the dark saloon car he had driven away in.
Mr Roof's social media presence suggests he was interested in white supremacy.
His Facebook profile page shows a picture of him wearing a jacket with flag-patches from apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia - the name of Zimbabwe during the era of white minority rule. He also had a Confederate flag plate on his car.
Dalton Tyler, who said he was a friend of Mr Roof, told ABC News the suspect had spoken in support of racial segregation and had said ""he wanted to start a civil war"".
It emerged on Thursday that the gunman had sat in a Bible study group at the church for nearly an hour before launching his attack.

36246869,"Sheikh Nawwaf al-Melhem, a leader of the officially-tolerated opposition People's Party, told the BBC he had brokered an agreement between the state and inmates at Hama Central Prison.
The prison's power and water supplies had now been restored, he said.
Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar said the situation at the prison was normal and denied there had been any disorder.
Human rights and opposition activists say the prisoners took guards hostage about a week ago as they tried to halt the transfer of several inmates to another facility where they believed they might be executed.
Security forces reportedly surrounded the jail and twice failed to retake it by force.
Sheikh Nawwaf, who is also a prominent tribal leader in central Syria, said he travelled to Hama Prison on Saturday afternoon.
The inmates' demands focused on ensuring fair and speedy trials for those detained without trial, and the release of those held without charge, he added.
Sheikh Nawwaf said he had presented the demands to Mr Shaar and Justice Minister Najm Hamad al-Ahmed in Hama on Sunday.
He said a deal to end the mutiny was reached later that day and included a promise from the government of fair trials for political detainees.
Leading rights activist Mazen Darwish, who is in touch with the prisoners, confirmed that a verbal agreement had been reached, but did not give any details.
Another activist told Reuters news agency the government had ""agreed to most of our demands to release those political detainees held without charge"".
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict in Syria, reported that 26 detainees would be released soon.
Later on Monday, the official Sana news agency reported that Mr Shaar and Mr Ahmed had visited the prison, and that they promised to ""provide inmates' needs"" and ensure that none were mistreated.
But it also cited a statement by the interior minister as saying that the situation there was ""normal, contrary to the lies and fabrications spread by malicious media outlets as part of their anti-Syria propaganda"".
The reported deal came after conditions worsened inside the prison, with authorities cutting electricity and water supplies, and inmates reporting a food shortage and serious medical cases.
Security forces also tried to storm the cell block where the prisoners were holding out on Friday and Saturday, using tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition.
The BBC was told that 15 prisoners were shot and wounded.
The revolt was sparked by a move to transfer several detainees to the notorious Sednaya Prison near Damascus.
""You can't imagine, even in your worst nightmare, what kind of torture [takes place] in Sednaya,"" a lawyer who is in contact with the prisoners told the BBC.

Most images though are menacing and hostile, reflecting the UK and the Midlands' often contradictory response to migrants.
Some show National Front marches in the 1970s and a landlady's window notice saying in stark terms: ""No coloureds"".
""What we wanted to do was to challenge people,"" curator Sarah Plumb told me.
""It's about asking them to question some of their negative stereotypes that are presented around migrants, often in the mainstream media.""

On Leicester's Hinckley Road, the Polish delis reflect the arrival of new migrants.
In excess of 45,000 migrants have settled in the East Midlands since 2011 alone. That's the estimate in findings compiled for the BBC by researchers at Oxford University.
According to new figures from the Office of National Statistics, net annual migration to the UK last year was under 300,000, with the largest group coming from Poland.
The East Midlands parliamentary constituencies with the biggest migrants are Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire, with 9,500, and Nottingham East with just over 8,000.
It's the food processing industries and farms that have made the East Midlands a particularly popular destination of choice. Only London noticeably attracts more.
""Migrant labour is hugely important to the East Midlands,"" said Simon Fisher, of the National Farmers' Union in Lincolnshire.
""They offer us the labour flexibility for picking potatoes and vegetables. Without them, we wouldn't be producing the food we do.""
But that influx worries East Midlands council leaders. They commissioned their own research on the knock-on effects, in a report entitled The Impact of International Migration on the East Midlands.
It revealed that up to 448,200 people in the East Midlands were foreign born. That's 10% of the region's population, compared with the UK average of 13.8%.
""Our findings showed there was an economic benefit from migration,"" said councillor Paul Kenny, leader of Boston Borough Council and chairman of the migration board of East Midlands Councils.
""But we also know from our experience that there are issues for our local communities.""

39042655,"Microplastics from tyres and textiles are a bigger source of marine pollution than the breakdown of larger plastic waste in some areas, says the IUCN.
Up to 30% of plastic released into the oceans each year comes from primary microplastics, not the disintegration of larger pieces, a report found.
Debris from tyre abrasion and synthetic fabrics are the main sources, they say.
The IUCN reviewed data from seven global regions to look at how much of the estimated 9.5 million tonnes of new plastic waste released into the oceans each year comes from primary microplastics.
These are tiny plastic particles from the likes of consumer products rather than the degradation of larger bits of plastic in the oceans.
The report found between 15% and 31% of plastic pollution came from primary microplastics, of which the biggest contributors (almost two-thirds) were abrasion of synthetic textiles, while washing, and abrasion of tyres, while driving.
Synthetic rubber, made from a variant of plastic, makes up around 60% of the rubber used in tyres.
Other sources included microbeads in cosmetics, which contributed about 2% of the releases to the ocean globally.
FranÃ§ois Simard, deputy director of IUCN's marine programme, said the findings came as a surprise.
""We discovered that most of the microplastics are coming from either the clothes or from the tyres,"" he told BBC News. ""Microplastics are going everywhere in the sea and into the food chain, let's close the plastic tap.""
IUCN director general Inger Andersen said the report was ""a real eye-opener"".
""Our daily activities, such as washing clothes and driving, significantly contribute to the pollution choking our oceans, with potentially disastrous effects on the rich diversity of life within them, and on human health,"" she said.
The release of microbeads from cosmetic products has received widespread publicity, resulting in action from manufacturers.
However, solving plastic pollution from tyres and synthetic clothes will be harder to address.
Joao de Sousa, marine project manager for the IUCN's global marine programme, said solutions must include product and infrastructure design as well as consumer behaviour.
For example, synthetic clothes could be designed to shed fewer fibres and consumers can act by choosing natural fabrics.
In parts of the world, such as North America, primary microplastics are a bigger source of marine plastic pollution than plastic waste, according to the report.
Meanwhile, synthetic textiles are the main source of primary microplastics in Asia and tyres dominate in the Americas, Europe and Central Asia.
Last month, a separate report by a scientific body that advises the UN on marine environmental protection highlighted concerns about debris from vehicle tyres.
Report co-editor Peter Kershaw called for further investigation and partnerships with industry to tackle the problem.

The 53-year-old, who was from Glasgow, was released from prison in September 2014 but was sought by police in April for breaching the terms of his licence.
Police described him at the time as ""potentially dangerous"". His death was being treated as unexplained.
Hamilton was nicknamed the Blackhill Butcher, after the Glasgow housing estate from which he operated.
He had been on the police's most-wanted list before he was jailed in 2000 over a string of charges including drug dealing, torture, abduction and sodomy.
Hamilton was sentenced to a minimum of nine years in prison after being found guilty at the High Court in Inverness.
The case was moved 200 miles from Glasgow amid fears that witnesses could be intimidated. Hamilton had evaded justice on 12 previous occasions when witnesses were too terrified to testify.
In court, a sickening picture emerged of how Hamilton, also known as the Fat Controller, entrapped young men with offers of drugs.
Two young drug addicts were imprisoned in a Glasgow flat, stabbed through the cheek and had boiling water poured over them.
Another attack in Edinburgh included an attempt to cut off a victim's finger.
Passing sentence, judge Lord Kingarth said: ""You showed yourself capable of taking sadistic pleasure in the infliction of pain and the inspiration of real terror over long periods. You pose a substantial danger to the public.""
When Police Scotland issued an appeal to find Hamilton in April they said he may be dangerous and urged members of the public not to approach him. A further appeal was made in June.
In October, an appeal was made on the BBC's Crimewatch programme and the Crimestoppers charity also offered a reward of Â£2,000 for information leading to his arrest.
Det Supt Kenny Graham said the site near West Calder where the remains were found would stay closed off or several more days ""whilst we complete further searches and specialists carry out their work"".
The nearby B7105 will also remain closed.
Det Supt Graham said: ""My condolences go out to the family of Martin Hamilton, who have had to receive such devastating news so close to Christmas.
""A team of officers is dedicated to this inquiry, so we can seek to give them answers as quickly as possible.

The anonymous donor had originally pledged some of the funds needed for the artwork but was moved to donate the full amount after watching the film Suffragette.
Ms Hawkins' grandson, Peter Barratt, said the donor had ""made dreams and ambitions come true"".

The California Kingsnake is non-venomous but can bite and rattle its tail.
It is thought he may have squeezed through the pipework in the block of flats.
Fiona Thorburn, of the Scottish SPCA, said: ""The lady was just about to have her dinner and got a real fright when she reached into the drawer to grab cutlery and found Zak curled up on the knives and forks.
""As she has a phobia of snakes, she called her friend for help to contain him only to discover that he had disappeared from the drawer.
""Thankfully they managed to locate him in a cupboard elsewhere in the kitchen before he sneaked away.
""Zak is quite large for an escapee and it's usually smaller snakes that can squeeze through pipework in flats.
""However, all snakes can be really good escape artists, so there's every chance Zak has an owner nearby who is looking for him.""",A woman with a fear of snakes discovered a 2ft-long kingsnake curled up in her kitchen drawer.

The charity said the dog - thought to be a springer or cocker spaniel - had been thrown into an enclosed gateway to a designated dog walking field.
It believed the pup, which has a docked tail, was left the night before.
RSPCA inspector Rosie Russon said: ""This poor pup is lucky to be alive.  When she was found, there was frozen solid faeces on the floor next to her.
""How she survived in such freezing conditions, I don't know.""
The dog is receiving treatment for a skin condition and sore eye at the charity's centre in Chobham, Surrey.
Ms Russon said that after a 14-day abandonment notice ends and she is fully recovered, the team will find her a new home.
She added: ""It's outrageous that somebody thought this was an appropriate way to dump their dog. It was an extremely cruel thing to do.""

38771866,"A 10-year spending plan, published in 2015, added £24.4bn for new maritime patrol aircraft, infantry vehicles, and to speed up the purchase of F35B jets.
However, a National Audit Office report warned it must first find £5.8bn in new savings to meet the extra commitments.
Defence minister Harriett Baldwin said it was delivering an affordable plan.
The government set out its Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) in November 2015, announcing £12bn in extra defence spending.
The review included plans for nine Boeing P8 maritime patrol aircraft - to replace the RAF's scrapped Nimrod jets - and that the purchase of 24 new F35 fighter aircraft would be accelerated.
The NAO report said additional planned expenditure amounted to £24.4bn of new commitments to the MoD budget.
The projected cost of funding the plan increased to £178bn - a rise of 7% - it said.
4,500 miles (7,200 km) maximum range without refuelling
490 knots (910km/h; 560mph) maximum speed
28 P-8A Poseidon aircraft in use by the United States
2 other countries, India and Australia, have variants of the aircraft in use or on order
The review said the MoD was already having to use a £10bn contingency fund set aside for emergencies and will have to find another £5.8bn in savings over the next 10 years.
The report warned the MoD had yet to generate £2.5bn of the £7.1bn savings already factored into the plan.
However, head of the NAO, Sir Amyas Morse, said the affordability of the equipment plan ""is at greater risk than at any time since its inception"".
""It is worrying to see that the costs of the new commitments arising from the review considerably exceed the net increase in funding for the plan.
""There is little room for unplanned cost growth and the MoD must actively guard against the risk of a return to previous practice where affordability could only be maintained by delaying or reducing the scope of projects.""
The spending plans have also been hit by recent currency fluctuations as the MoD looks to buy new equipment from the US.
Minister for Defence Procurement Harriett Baldwin said the 10-year plan would deliver ""the best kit for our armed forces at the best value for the taxpayer"".
""We are focused on maintaining an affordable programme and delivering the efficiencies we need to reinvest in cutting-edge ships, planes, versatile strike brigades, and greater cyber capabilities, so that our Armed Forces have the equipment they need to keep the UK safe and secure.""","The Ministry of Defence will struggle to afford plans to buy new jets, ships and armoured vehicles, the government spending watchdog has warned."

""We, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us,"" Brandon Dixon said.
The incident has angered President-elect Donald Trump, who has accused the cast of ""harassing"" his running mate.
The President-elect has gone as far as to demand an apology to a ""very good man"", apparently misunderstanding that the cast implored the audience to stop booing Mr Pence.
""Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!"" Mr Trump tweeted.
""The theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!""
His tweet did not go unnoticed by Mr Dixon, who immediately stepped in to defend his castmates.
""@realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir,"" he wrote. ""And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen.""
Mr Pence was loudly booed as he entered the theatre. Audience members said the performance was repeatedly stopped because of jeers.
However, the message, which was reportedly penned by the show's writers when they learned that Mr Pence planned to attend, was greeted with cheers from the audience at the Richard Rogers Theatre in New York.
An audience member tweeted to say there was a three-minute standing ovation when one character performed a song directly to Mr Pence which included the lyrics: ""A small query for you / What comes next? / You've been freed / Do you know how hard it is to lead?""
When Mr Dixon addressed theatregoers at the end, he urged them not to boo and asked Mr Pence, who was leaving, to stay and listen.
""You know, we had a guest in the audience this evening, and Vice-President-elect Pence, I see you are walking out but I hope you will hear us.
""There's nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen... We have a message for you, sir, and we hope you will hear us out.""
Mr Dixon continued: ""We truly hope that his show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us.
""We truly thank you for sharing this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men and women of different colours, creeds, and orientations.""
A staunch conservative, Mr Pence sparked an outcry earlier this year after signing a law critics said discriminated against the LGBT community by allowing businesses to refuse service over religious beliefs. He later amended the bill.
He is not the first high-profile politician to attend the critically-acclaimed and hugely popular Hamilton, which tells the story of US founding father Alexander Hamilton.
President Barack Obama saw the musical last year and joined the cast backstage after the performance.
Hillary Clinton, who lost to Mr Trump in last week's election, also saw the show. She was supported by its creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, during her campaign.

In the UK, its biggest market, Santander said the Brexit vote had resulted in ""economic uncertainty and financial market volatility"".
It said it had put aside £30m extra for Payment Protection Insurance claims.
The bank's net profit for the quarter dropped to £477m in the UK, down from £496m for the same period last year. It was also down in its third-biggest market, Spain.
However, its second-biggest market, Brazil, saw a ""strong performance"", with an increase in both profit and net interest income.
The group's net interest income - the money it made on lending, measured by the difference between the interest it gets from borrowers and what it pays savers - fell by 2.3% to €7.79bn.
""While the low-interest-rate environment within developed economies remains a challenge for parts of our business, the resilience of our business model has allowed us to continue to deliver, with our Latin American and consumer finance franchises growing particularly well throughout the year.,"" said the group's executive chairman, Ana Botin.
However, she added: ""We expect to end 2016 exceeding last year's profit, enabling us to increase our dividend per share and earnings per share.""
In its UK management statement, the bank said it expected the country's decision to leave the EU to result in the near term in ""lower consumer confidence and, over time, lower economic growth"".
""In addition, the lower value of sterling, when combined with an ongoing increase in oil prices, is likely to lead to higher inflation,"" it added.
Nathan Bostock, UK chief executive, added: ""Although we have not seen a material impact on our business in the short period since the EU referendum, we do expect a more challenging macroeconomic environment ahead.""
The additional £30m provision for PPI mis-selling in the third quarter means that in the first nine months of this year, Santander has set aside £397m for compensation and related costs.
It said the provision ""represents our best estimate of future PPI-related claims costs, including the impact of the delayed two-year time bar"".
Lloyds Banking Group announced on Thursday it had set aside an extra £1bn in the third quarter to handle PPI costs.
Challenger bank Metro Bank also reported quarterly profits on Wednesday.
The bank, which listed on the London Stock Exchange in March, saw underlying pre-tax profits jump by 118% to £600,000 compared with the second quarter, when it made a loss of £3.4m. It did not report an equivalent figure for the third quarter of 2015.
Its net interest margin was 1.95% - up from 1.93%, compared with the second quarter, where, again, it did not report an equivalent figure.
Metro, which offers retail, business and private banking, said customer accounts had risen from 780,000 in the three months to 30 September to 848,000.
Lending increased by 73% to £5.19bn. while total deposits were up 66% to £7.3bn.
""I am delighted to announce another strong quarter, with substantial growth across lending, deposits and customer accounts, as well as the bank reporting its first quarterly underlying profit,"" said chief executive Craig Donaldson.","Spanish bank Santander has reported a rise in net profit in the third quarter compared with a year ago, helped by its performance in emerging markets in Latin America."

The 52-year-old, a three-term tea party Republican from Wichita, Kansas, is a vehement critic of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran.
He has also defended the National Security Agency's bulk data collection programme and opposes shutting the prison at Guantanamo Bay.
After visiting the detention facility in 2013, he remarked that some inmates who had declared a hunger strike looked like they had put on weight.
Mr Pompeo also defended the CIA after the 2014 release of the Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Torture, which detailed such interrogation practices as waterboarding.
He declared: ""These men and women are not torturers, they are patriots"".
The CIA tactics, he declared, ""were within the law, within the constitution"".
Mr Pompeo graduated first in his class at West Point and graduated from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of its Law Review.
He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 with the support of the Republican mega-donors Charles and David Koch.
Mr Pompeo became a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
Before joining Congress, Mr Pompeo founded an aviation parts firm and an oilfield supply company.
He was accused of Islamophobia for remarks he made following the deadly 2013 Boston marathon bombing.
Mr Pompeo took to the House floor to suggest some Islamic faith leaders might be tacitly encouraging terrorist attacks.
""When the most devastating terrorist attacks on America in the last 20 years come overwhelmingly from people of a single faith and are performed in the name of that faith a special obligation falls on those that are the leaders of that faith,"" he said.
""Instead of responding, silence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts and, more importantly still, in those that may well follow.""
While he was a congressional candidate in 2010, one of his campaign aides sent a tweet linking to an article that labelled his Indian-American Democratic opponent Raj Goyle a ""turban topper"".
Mr Pompeo apologised; his campaign also sent out billboard ads urging everyone to ""vote American"".
He also served on the House Select Benghazi Committee, a special panel created in 2014 to investigate the deadly attack two years earlier on a US diplomatic compound in Libya.
Democrats described it as a political witch hunt against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Mr Pompeo released a report afterwards accusing her of intentionally misleading Americans about the nature of the attack to help President Barack Obama's re-election bid.","The United States' likely new spymaster, Mike Pompeo, is a hardline Republican Congressman and a national security hawk with a background in military and intelligence affairs."

Officials and residents of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier gathered outside the town hall on Saturday morning to observe a minute's silence.
Mr Salhi was arrested at the Air Products factory on Friday morning.
Later, anti-terror police searched the apartment of Mr Salhi, a father-of-three, in the Moines neighbourhood of the town.
They took his wife and sister into custody. Another man was arrested but released without charge.
Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office, has said police have so far not found any motive or possible foreign connection, and that Mr Salhi is not speaking to investigators.
Under French anti-terrorism laws, suspects can be held for up to four days before either being released or charged.
Yassin Salhi had been investigated in the past about his alleged links with Islamist militants.
It is alleged he was waved through the gates of the factory because he was a regular delivery driver.
Police and firefighters later found a half-destroyed car which had been rammed into canisters containing chemicals and a man trying to ignite more.
Mr Salhi's boss, a 54-year-old man whose name has not been released by police, was found beheaded at the scene.
His head had been placed on the factory railings. It is not clear when he died.
Speaking after the attack, President Hollande said: ""We have no doubt that the attack was to blow up the building. It bears the hallmarks of a terrorist attack.""
He said the attack would remind people of the attacks in and around Paris in January that killed 17 people.

35052404,"It had been thought that being unhappy was bad for health - particularly for the heart.
But the decade-long analysis, published in the Lancet, said previous studies had just confused cause and effect.
However, experts argued that unhappiness in childhood may still have a lasting impact.
A series of studies had shown that how happy people are, strongly predicts how long they are going to live.
Ideas included detrimental changes in stress hormones or the immune system resulting in a higher risk of death.
But the research team in the UK and Australia said those studies failed to deal with reverse causality - namely, that people who are ill are not very happy.
Participants in the Million Women Study were asked to regularly rate their health, happiness and levels of stress.
The results showed that whether people were ""never"", ""usually"" or ""mostly"" happy had no impact on their odds of dying during the duration of the study once other factors such as health or whether they smoked were taken into account.
Dr Bette Liu, one of the researchers at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: ""Illness makes you unhappy, but unhappiness itself doesn't make you ill.
""We found no direct effect of unhappiness or stress on mortality, even in a 10-year study of a million women.""
Co-author Prof Sir Richard Peto, from the University of Oxford, said light smokers had double the risk of an early death and regular smokers had three times the risk of dying during the study period, but that happiness was ""irrelevant"".
He said it could have indirect effects if people started consuming large amounts of alcohol or massively overeating, but happiness itself ""does not have any material, direct, effect on mortality"".

But Rosberg said: ""It is all ready to go. It just needs to be put on the car.
""For sure we all want it to be put on the car as soon as possible. I am disappointed and we'll look into that.""
Some drivers believe it was the right decision to postpone the introduction of the halo.

Renault's Jolyon Palmer said: ""F1 safety is very good at the moment. We have very big run offs, I am pretty happy with the safety levels we have at the moment.
""It is personal preference, I know a lot of the drivers, especially the younger ones, are in the same camp as me.""
But Rosberg said: ""The large majority of drivers agree we need to get it on the car as soon as possible. It makes sense.
""It is such a huge step for safety.""
The Grand Prix Drivers' Association [GPDA] has been vocal in pushing for the introduction of the halo and on Thursday its chairman, former F1 driver Alexander Wurz, said he ""hoped F1 does not come to regret the decision"".
Wurz added that it ""could almost be seen as 'business first and safety second'"".
Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel, a director of the GPDA, said: ""I haven't read exactly what the reasoning was. It still remains positive that from 2018 onwards it is going to be on the car.""
The decision to postpone the introduction of the halo caught some team insiders by surprise as all had been given the impression so far this year by the FIA, motorsport's world governing body, that it was working towards introducing the device in 2017.
F1 race director Charlie Whiting said the main reason for the delay was to give more time for drivers to assess its impact.
Whiting said: ""The decision was taken that simply because only three drivers have ever tried it, and they have only done a total of four laps.
""This was something that everyone felt was quite a relevant thing and it wouldn't really be feasible to expect, in the short term, to get the relevant number of laps with the halo. That was the reason for introducing if for 2018 instead of 2017.""

The company has recently been paying creators for exclusive premium video content, and is heavily promoting the Facebook Live feature that allows users to live stream events.
Facebook says the standalone app will be released ""soon"".
The only screen Facebook doesn't dominate right now is the biggest one in your home.
The company's decision to launch these TV apps - which we've been expecting for some time now - is the first significant step the company has made to build its challenge to the likes of Netflix and Hulu.
To do that, though, it will need to offer programmes that are of a far higher quality than what is on Facebook right now. That will require big investment in getting top talent to make Facebook-only video.
One interesting move will be how it plans to make money from TV. If Facebook feels it can make its content free (with income coming from advertising), then it could give subscriber services like Netflix and Amazon Prime serious pause for thought.

32820581,"McKinnon was also interviewed for the vacancy at St Mirren, but the Paisley club instead appointed Dumbarton's Ian Murray.
The 44-year-old has joined Rovers on a two-year contract.
Chief executive Eric Drysdale said: ""Ray ticks all the boxes and we are confident he can take us forward.""
Rovers were seeking a new manager after Grant Murray, who had been in charge for three years, was sacked in April following five straight defeats.
Now Malpas, the 52-year-old former Motherwell and Swindon Town manager who had been in his role since December, has also left the Kirkcaldy club.
""As promised, the board has taken great care in its search for someone to replace Grant Murray,"" said Drysdale.
""We spoke in detail to four of the very best candidates from a very long list of applicants.
""Only one, Ray, was formally offered the job and we are very pleased that he has accepted.""
Former Rovers player McKinnon, who previously managed junior club Lochee United, recently signed a new contract at Glebe Park.
First-team coach Laurie Ellis took charge of the Kirkcaldy side for the final Scottish Championship match of the season - a 2-2 draw away to Dumbarton - as they finished in sixth place.
McKinnon, who took over as Brechin boss in 2012, led his side to a fourth-place finish in League One this season.
However, they missed out on promotion after losing 2-1 on aggregate to Alloa Athletic in their play-off semi-final.
McKinnon, who began his career at Tannadice, had two spells as a player at Stark's Park.
He made five appearances in 2000 after leaving Livingston before joining Portadown, and Rovers were his final senior club, making 12 appearances in 2003 after leaving Montrose.
McKinnon also had spells with Nottingham Forest, Luton Town, Stirling Albion, East Fife and Torquay United and finished his career in junior football with Lochee and Broughty Athletic.","Ray McKinnon has left Brechin City to become Raith Rovers manager, with Maurice Malpas standing down as director of football at Stark's Park."
39231082,"400 Football League games later, however, Flynn will lead the Exiles to Crewe Alexandra at the weekend as their manager after the sacking of Graham Westley, albeit with the club teetering on the edge of being relegated back to non-league.
But the wilderness of the non-league scene is exactly where the lifelong association between Flynn and Newport begun.
Given a reprieve by manager Tim Harris and a chance with the first team after his youth team axing, Flynn also found employment as a postman.
Thanks to his form with the Exiles, a nickname earned rather than chosen after years spent out of the city as a reformed club without a home, Flynn impressed as a midfielder with an eye for goal. In the non-league pyramid at least, this postman did always deliver.
A switch to full time football was the dream, achieved with a transfer to Barry Town, a move that changed the course of Flynn's life.
There was to be no future in shelf stacking or letter delivering for Flynn after joining the full time Welsh Premier League side, as he went on to make over 400 Football League appearances for the likes of Gillingham, Wigan and Bradford City.
He returned to his first club and first love Newport County five years ago, helping to steer them to a promotion 25 years in the making.
Flynn was 'heartbroken' when the club released him as Terry Butcher axed 11 players, after Newport's millionaire chairman Les Scadding opted to walk away from the club.
He soon returned when the Supporters' Trust succeeded Scadding, working in various roles including as a club ambassador, in marketing, and as a first team coach.
He even found time to get in a few games for Welsh League third-tier side Undy, so it was no surprise this season when Flynn came out of retirement to help the beleaguered Exiles.
Flynn's career at County, and in football, was almost over before it started.
""I got kicked out of the youth team. The youth team manager Glyn Jones asked me what I had done at the weekend and I said I had played for Pill. He said 'I know, I saw in the local paper you scored a hat-trick.' So he kicked me out for breaking his rules,"" he recalls.
""I went away crying, it killed me. But the next day Tim Harris rang me and said 'come and train with the first team.' I had just started working as a postman and I had been stacking shelves in Tesco. so it was a relief.
""I earned a contract though and then a move to Barry, which meant I went full time.
""But I always looked out for Newport, for my entire career and I played over 400 games in the Football League.
""It was hard to leave the club and the city. I had to do it to better my career, to better my life.""
Flynn, generally a bubbly and talkative character, struggles to express how he feels about his hometown club.
""It is really difficult to put it into words what it means to me, it is everything,"" he said.
""It is the togetherness of the city, the good days, the bad times, throughout the years. We have seen the fans of this club come together and drag it back to where it came from again.
""The enjoyment on children's faces when they come to games, seeing them being part of it and become the future fans of the coming years.
""The club for me is everything, it is a lot more than just football. And I think every fan around the country who supports their team will understand what I mean.
""I want my kids to see me do well for Newport, I am a Newport boy and seeing this club be successful is everything I want.""
Flynn says the task of keeping Newport in the Football League is not impossible, even though they are 11 points adrift with just 12 games remaining.
""It is not impossible, it is going to be hard, it is going to be tough, I am not going to dress it up as something it isn't, but we will keep fighting,"" he said.
""We will keep going until the end as that is what the fans of this club deserve. The players will be under no illusion about what this means to the fans, to the club and to their careers. Nothing is impossible.""","When Newport County threw a teenage Michael Flynn out of their youth academy for defying club rules, he feared he would spend his life doing his part time job, stacking shelves in the local supermarket."
40130436,"The Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers' index rose to 56 from 53.1, its highest level since December 2015. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.
Builders also hired more workers and ordered more supplies to deal with an increase in new projects.
Economists said the sector was recovering after a slow start to 2017.
""A sustained rebound in residential building provides an encouraging sign that the recent a soft patch for property values has not deterred new housing supply,"" said Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit.
""Instead, strong labour market conditions, resilient demand and ultra-low mortgage rates appear to have helped boost work on residential development projects.""
The data contrasts with reports earlier this week suggesting greater caution by homebuyers and lenders.
Building society Nationwide said house prices had fallen for a third consecutive in May - the longest run of decline since 2009, just after the financial crisis.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England said loan approvals fell to a seven-month low in April.
The latest Markit/CIPS construction reading was still much weaker than the post-crisis high of 64.6 seen in January 2014.
However, the survey found there had been solid rises across the whole sector in May, including in civil engineering and commercial building.
Input prices for construction firms also rose at the slowest pace for seven months, despite the prolonged weakness of the pound.
Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result suggested the Brexit vote's ""dampening influence on construction activity is fading"".
But he added: ""Note, however, that the PMI has had to exceed 53 in the past to signal growth.
""May's PMI reading, therefore, is consistent with quarter-on-quarter growth in construction output of only about 0.5%.""","Activity in the UK construction sector expanded at its fastest rate in 17 months in May, boosted by a surprise rebound in homebuilding, a survey says."
35111956,"Biju John, 44, pleaded guilty to outraging public decency in Harlow and was due to be sentenced in 2011 when he fled the UK.
The details emerged as John was struck off by a panel, which heard one of his victims felt ""degraded and scared"".
Essex Police said John was still wanted by officers.
John, then a doctor at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, took covert videos of women, without their knowledge, at The Harvey Centre in April 2011.
It is understood he used a bag containing a concealed camera.
One victim told police: ""The incident has made me feel dirty and degraded. I feel like I can't wear a skirt anymore and I am going to be scared every time I see a man with a bag.
""I feel violated as if he has actually touched me inappropriately. At this moment in time I am very upset and shocked.""
Chelmsford magistrates released John on bail to be sentenced in May 2011, by which time he had already left the UK.
The panel heard he then phoned his colleague Jeffrey Philips, a consultant in intensive care.
""He understood that Dr John had flown out on the day of the Royal wedding, which took place on 29 April 2011, in the belief that the airport would be quiet,"" the panel heard.
Police broke down the door of his rented flat in Dads Wood, Harlow, a week later and found food in the fridge that was weeks out of date.
Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service said it had served notice about its hearing to John's parents in India.
In reaching its decision, the panel said: ""Public confidence in the medical profession would be seriously undermined if Dr John was not erased from the medical register after indicating a guilty plea to an offence related to his actions in filming beneath women's skirts, and then fleeing the country prior to sentencing.
It added: ""Ms A [the victim] had been caused significant and understandable distress.
""In addition, it considered that the public would also regard Dr John's action in absconding before sentencing to be wholly reprehensible and unbecoming of a doctor.
An Essex Police spokeswoman said: ""He is believed to have left the country and is currently wanted.""

She handed over to her husband, Lt Col Alan Wilkinson, last month.
The exchange makes the pair, who married in 1998, the highest ranking couple to follow each other in a command role.
Gill, 45, originally from Northern Ireland, was in the Army from the mid-90s but left when her two children were born.
She re-enlisted in the Army reserve in 2003 and took command of the regiment in 2014.
Husband Alan, 46, who was also in the Army before joining the Army Reserve, took on the role of main carer for their children when Gill became CO (commanding officer).
Gill told BBC Scotland: ""It almost feels like I handed over the children to him two-and-a-half years before taking command and this feels very similar.
""You do feel a responsibility for a regiment. It is quite a parental role. Your soldiers are like your family.
""Normally when a commanding officer leaves command they don't look back at the regiment, they leave the next CO to carry on.
""Obviously I'm trying to do that but I can keep an eye out and ask how people are getting on and satisfy that parental bit.""
Alan, originally from the Borders, met Gill at Dundee University before joining the Army.
He joined the reserves in 2009.
Alan said taking over from his wife was no different to any new job.
He said: ""We have worked closely together throughout our career in the Army. I was in the fortunate position of being able to speak to Gill in the months before about it so it only took about four days to handover. It was fine.""
Gill, who will now work with the Army Reserve part-time, said opportunities for women were ""getting wider"".
She said: ""When I joined the Royal Logistic Corps it was because it offered, as far as I was concerned, the greatest opportunity to do the same job as men were doing.
""It is still majority male but the regiment I was commanding was about a quarter to a third female.""
""I think ever since I joined the Army it has been increasing with more and more opportunities opening up.

38305414,"A Lords EU committee has called for an immediate ""unilateral undertaking"" that EU nationals can continue to live, work and study in the UK after Brexit.
It said failure to do this would have a severe impact on migrants' rights.
Ministers say they expect this to happen but need equivalent guarantees for UK citizens on the Continent.
The question of what will happen to the estimated 2.9 million citizens of other EU countries who have made their home in the UK in recent years is one of the most controversial arising from the UK's vote to leave the EU in June's referendum.
The government has said it expects an early resolution of the issue once official talks on the terms of the UK's separation from the EU begin next spring.
But it has refrained from giving any guarantees on their future status - saying this is impossible without similar safeguards for the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in Spain, France, Italy and other EU countries.
But the Lords EU Justice sub-committee said the UK should not wait to hear from other EU countries and that making a binding commitment now was ""morally the right thing to do"".
If this was not possible before Article 50 is triggered, expected before the end of March, the peers said the issue should be negotiated separately from other matters to ensure a ""preliminary"" agreement as quickly as possible.
Without any agreement, it said EU nationals living in the UK would be subject to ""Byzantine"" national immigration laws and many would be unable to meet the criteria for permanent residency despite having been here for more than five years.
""The government is under a moral obligation to give a unilateral declaration immediately to safeguard the EU citizenship rights of all EU nationals in the UK when the UK withdraws from the EU,"" said Baroness Kennedy QC, the Labour peer who chairs the cross-party committee.
""I also believe that such a gesture will stimulate reciprocal commitments from the other EU countries where UK citizens are currently living.
""For the last six months, the lives of EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU have been shrouded in anxiety.
""Their rights to live, work and reside in their country of choice are now so unclear that people have no idea how, or even where, they should plan their futures.""
The government has said it wants to limit the currently unconditional right of EU citizens to come to the UK as part of the Brexit settlement.
In their report, the peers said the principle of ""acquired rights"" was narrow and hard to enforce in international law and that the full scope of rights would have to be guaranteed in the Brexit agreement for it to withstand legal challenge.
Officials have indicated there would have to be some cut-off point after which full rights could not be guaranteed but have not said when this would be.
A government spokesman said: ""We're determined to get the best possible deal for the UK and are preparing for a smooth and orderly exit from the EU.
""The prime minister has been clear that she wants to protect the status of EU nationals already living here, and the only circumstances in which that wouldn't be possible is if British citizens' rights in European member states were not protected in return.""
In a separate development, Whitehall has been warned that it needs to be better resourced to cope with EU negotiations and make a success of them.
The Institute for Government said Downing Street's ""desire for secrecy"" was hindering preparations for Brexit and more was needed ""in terms of money, staff and information"".
Brexit Secretary David Davis is likely to be questioned on both issues when he appears before the Commons Select Committee on exiting the EU for the first time later.","The UK has a ""moral"" duty to guarantee the status of EU nationals living in the country ahead of negotiations over its exit, a group of peers has said."

Sir Nicholas, dubbed the ""British Schindler"", helped to save hundreds of children, mainly from Jewish families, from the Nazis by transporting them by train from Prague to the UK in 1939.
The wheelchair-bound 105-year-old said: ""I think it's a wonderful honour to have the building named after me.
""I hope the school will make contact with a school in the Czech Republic that is also named after me.""
Other guests included Home Secretary Theresa May, MP for Maidenhead.
The school was proposed in February 2012 and then approved by the Department for Education through the free schools programme in June 2012.
Once it reaches capacity, the school will have 500 pupils, including 225 boarders aged 11-19 years.
Parents pay £3,850 a term for boarders but daytime education is free.

Sales also rose 20% to $23.2bn in the second quarter to the end of June, boosted by strong growth in the US.
Its shares, which fell 1.3% during the day, leapt 18.5% to $571.24 a share in after-hours trading on Wall Street.
The firm was also upbeat on its prospects for the current third quarter, forecasting sales would grow between 13% and 24% compared to last year, much higher than analysts had predicted.
Sales in North America rose 25.5% to $13.8bn in the second quarter, driven by purchases of electronic goods and general merchandise, helping to drive the strong performance.
Its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, also made a contribution, with sales up 81% compared to the same quarter last year.
It said its widely promoted ""Prime Day"" on 15th July - which offered special deals to customers who signed up to its fast delivery service - had been a success with more new members trying it globally than any other day in the firm's history.
Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos credited hard work for the results: ""The teams at Amazon have been working hard for customers,"" he said.
Throughout its history, Amazon's revenue has climbed while its profit has hovered around or below zero.
On Thursday evening, the e-commerce company reported a profit.
As customers in North America bought electronics and others products, sales in its biggest market rose more than 25% compared to last year.
And if you thought Microsoft's cloud computing business did well, then take a look at Amazon web services which includes its cloud business - revenue soared more than 80 percent.
The only slight negative was that sales growth outside the US wasn't nearly as impressive.

""It's a difficult environment, but two outstanding saves from Craig Gordon or it could have been more.""
A Celtic victory would have been their 23rd in succession in the league and their 18th in all competitions.
The Premiership leaders took a first-half lead thanks to Stuart Armstrong's well-taken goal.
Rangers, in front of their new manager, Pedro Caixinha, who was watching from the stands, continued to battle and were rewarded with Hill's 88th-minute goal.
""He saw the players deal with an unbelievable atmosphere,"" Murty said.

Chris Fraser, of Sirius, said its case stood ""up to scrutiny"" and it was determined to pursue the plan.
The North York Moors National Park Authority is to consider a planning application on 30 June.
The 229-page report by the park authority does not make any recommendation about the proposed mine.
It acknowledged that there were likely to be economic benefits but said the proposal did not represent ""exceptional circumstances"".
The report said the National Park Authority's statutory responsibility was to ""conserve and enhance the North York Moors for the enjoyment of present and future generations"".
Sirius said it believed exceptional circumstances had been demonstrated and the mining was in the public interest, with environmental effects ""mitigated"".
The term ""potash"" is used to describe a range of minerals containing potassium, and the proposal is to mine polyhalite.
The mine would transform North Yorkshire's economy, Ryedale District Council and Scarborough Borough Council has claimed.
However a report published earlier this month suggested that the five-year construction phase of the mine would cost the area's tourism industry £10m a year.
The Campaign for National Parks said it hoped the authority would reject the planning application.
The decision was an ""important test of the protection afforded national parks"" and there were strong planning grounds for turning it down, it added.
Plans include a construction of a minehead at Dove's Nest Farm and Haxby Plantation about 1.6 miles (2.5km) from the village of Sneaton involving mining shafts, buildings, roads and a helicopter landing site on a 64-hectare site.",A report into a planned £1.7bn potash mine has said its economic benefits do not outweigh the harm it would cause the North York Moors national park.

The proposals were approved at the English Football League's annual general meeting in Portugal this week.
Since the decision was announced Portsmouth, Accrington Stanley, AFC Wimbledon, Hartlepool United and Luton Town have released statements to confirm they voted against the trial.
EFL clubs approve academy 'Rooney Rule'
In a statement, the EFL said it was piloting the changes as part of their ""ongoing commitment to creating more and better home grown players"".
The changes will see the 16 academy sides evenly distributed throughout the groups alongside the League One and League Two clubs, with the competition continuing to run on a north/south basis until the final.
Each team will play each other once in the group stage, with the academy team getting just one home game. The knockout stages will be single ties apart from the semi-finals, where there will be two legs.
At the AGM, clubs approved a 'Rooney Rule'-style application process to try to improve the number of black and ethnic minority coaches in the game.
They also discussed the EFL's proposals to add a new division of 20 teams to the English pyramid - meaning that there would be 100 teams in a five-division structure, rather than the current set-up of 92 clubs across four tiers.

Smoke could be seen billowing from shops on the outskirts of the market on Thursday, as dozens of fire engines tackled the flames.
The fire was out by Thursday night and there were no reports of injuries.
Tsukiji's interior industrial market - where the famous tuna auctions take place - was undamaged and the area was open to tourists as usual.
The blaze broke out at about 16:50 local time (07:50 GMT), Japanese broadcaster NHK said, in the outer region of the market and close to the surrounding area's narrow streets.
The area is home to many sushi restaurants and shops, some of which have been evacuated, NHK reports.
The cause of the fire is not yet known. The blaze seems to have affected several old wooden buildings.
The market was constructed in 1935, in the aftermath of the great Kanto earthquake of 1923, and built largely from corrugated iron sheds.
Today, it is a sprawling, busy market, but is seen by many as rundown and overcrowded.
Nonetheless, its enormous volume and variety of produce means it receives tens of thousands of tourist visitors each year.
The market is due to be moved by the end of 2017.
Efforts to move the market to a more modern location have been met with resistance by many of the workers, some of whom have been in the family business for generations.
Tokyo's governor, Yuriko Koike, has previously said the market needs to be rebuilt because of its age - and the associated risk of it being vulnerable to earthquakes, which are not uncommon in Japan.",Firefighters have extinguished a blaze at Japan's famous Tsukiji fish market - the largest in the world and a top tourist attraction.
33434144,"The rules will also apply to less senior staff who could nonetheless do serious harm to a bank.
It comes two years after a parliamentary commission proposed a shake-up of the UK banking industry in the wake of the financial crisis.
The regime will take effect from March.
The new rules follow a public outcry after a series of scandals in the industry, including Libor rigging and foreign exchange rate fixing.
The Chancellor George Osborne said in his annual Mansion House speech last month: ""The public rightly asks why it is that after so many scandals, and such cost to the country, so few individuals have faced punishment in the courts.""
The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said at the same event that the ""age of irresponsibility"" was over as he set out new plans for jail terms for rogue bankers and traders who manipulate markets to be lengthened from seven to 10 years.
Earlier today, the former UBS and Citigroup trader Tom Hayes, who is accused of manipulating the Libor rate, told a court at his trial that senior managers knew what he was doing.
""I acted with complete transparency... My managers knew, my manager's manager knew. In some cases the CEO [chief executive] was aware of it,"" he said.
Mr Hayes is the first person to be prosecuted over the Libor scandal which cost Barclays Bank a then record Â£290m in 2012 before Royal Bank of Scotland  Â£390m for its part in the scandal.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA)  - part of the Bank of England  - said their new rules would place the ""burden of proof"" on top banking executives in incidents of wrongdoing within their companies.
The rules replace existing arrangements that require regulators to prove senior executives were responsible for wrongdoing.
FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley said: ""Today we have given clarity on  rules that will embed personal accountability into the culture of the City. New conduct rules will add further momentum to improving standards across the industry.""
The PRA's rule book sets out a list of key individuals to be held to account including chief executives, finance directors, chairmen and senior non-independent directors.
It means senior banking figures will be subject to a new ""presumption of responsibility"", meaning they will be guilty of misconduct if rules are broken in a part of a bank under their control.
The PRA will consider what they knew or ought to have known about the breach, scrutinising meeting minutes, email and telephone records.
Bankers will avoid punishment if they can show they took reasonable steps to avoid rules being broken, such as pre-emptive actions including reviews of the business.
A certification regime will cover staff who give investment advice as well as traders submitting benchmarks - such as for interbank lending rate Libor.
The FCA said it was consulting on expanding the latter to cover a wider scope of traders' activity.
Regulators are also proposing a new package of measures to formalise banks' procedures for whistleblowing.
British Bankers' Association (BBA) executive director Simon Hills said: ""This new framework will help to restore trust and confidence in the banking industry damaged by the events of the last decade.
""A banking industry that sets the gold standard for accountability is good for customers and investors as well as those serving in it.""",City regulators have published final rules that make top bank executives responsible for the misconduct of their employees -unless they can show they took steps to stop it.

Colin Ackermann hit a six off the final ball as Leicestershire edged out Lancashire in a thrilling finish.
Surrey beat Somerset despite a 12-run over-rate penalty and there were also wins for holders Northants and Kent.
A total of 66 sixes were struck in Sunday's five games, 19 of them in the Sussex v Glamorgan game.
While South Africa's Test team crashed to a 211-run defeat against England at Lord's, it was a good day for some of their compatriots on the county circuit - especially those playing for Glamorgan.
Chief among them was Ingram, who hit seven sixes to rescue his side from 7-2. He added 130 with former Proteas batsman Jacques Rudolph (49) and then 70 off the final six overs with Johannesburg-born Chris Cooke (37 not out) as they posted 198-3.
When it was Glamorgan's turn to field, Ingram weighed in with the wickets of Ross Taylor and Ben Brown. And although Wright equalled Ingram's sixes tally in his 101 off 53 balls, he fell to another South African, Marchant de Lange, in the penultimate over as they came up short on 180-6.
At Aigburth, Liam Livingstone (48 off 34 balls) and Jos Buttler (39 off 21) were the main contributors to Lancashire Lightning's 173-9.
Leicestershire looked comfortable needing only six off the final over, but Mathew Pillans was run out after four singles to start the over.
Ackermann was on strike for the final ball from Kyle Jarvis and managed to clear the rope at deep extra cover to finish with an unbeaten 62 off 41 balls as they won by three wickets.
""In T20 cricket you have to come in with good intent, to hit the ball and to run hard,"" he told BBC Radio Leicester.
Somerset looked dead and buried against Surrey at The Oval as they were reduced to 82-7 after Arran Finch's 61 off 42 balls led the home side to 181-7.
But Surrey had reckoned without New Zealander Corey Anderson, who raced to a 30-ball half-century - and a decision by the umpires to award 12 penalty runs to the visitors because of their poor over-rate.
Somerset needed 12 to win off the last over, but Anderson was run out for 81 - and innings featuring seven sixes - and Surrey scraped home by four runs.
""They said we were tight, but I certainly was trying to do everything I could (to keep the rate up),"" Surrey skipper Jade Dernbach told BBC Radio London.
""The other night, being on TV, there seemed to be a different kind of timekeeping taking place compared to this game. I'd like to see some consistency from a captain's point of view, so we know we're at. But we still got over the line and that's the most important thing.""
Essex import Mohammed Amir came in for some rough treatment from the Kent batsmen at Beckenham, with Joe Denly hitting three sixes and a four in his second over as they tried to defend a score of 166-8.
Denly (32) and Sam Northeast (33) were removed by spinner Simon Harmer (2-21), but unlike the final over of the Essex innings in which three wickets fell, Kent opener Daniel Bell-Drummond saw his side home with a six off Amir, whose 3.3 overs cost 41 runs.
Bell-Drummond was 90 not out as Kent reached 169-3 with nine balls to spare, having struck four sixes and eight fours.
At Chester-le-Street, South Africans Rory Kleinveldt (3-28) and Tabraiz Shamsi (2-20) helped Northants restrict Durham Jets to 161-7, despite an unbeaten 53 by Jack Burnham.

""It is a great moment in the 55-year history of these awards to honour four women.

34130280,"Gareth Graham was giving evidence to a Stormont inquiry into the National Asset Management Agency's (Nama) Â£1bn sale of its Northern Ireland loan portfolio.
Loans held by his property companies were sold to Cerberus, the US investment fund, as part of that deal.
Mr Graham said he has tapes of ""thousands"" of phone calls made by Frank Cushnahan, a businessman who worked with him and was later a Nama advisor.
The tapes were made between 2005 and 2008 when Mr Cushnahan worked with the Graham family's bookmaking business.
The committee was told the tapes would be made available to law enforcement agencies.
Phonecalls in and out of the Grahams' business were recorded for regulatory reasons.
The business relationship between the Grahams and Mr Cushnahan broke down in 2008.
Mr Graham claimed Mr Cushnahan was then ""intent on destroying our businesses"".
Mr Cushnahan has previously issued a statement to the media denying any wrongdoing.
Mr Graham added that he has already spoken to the National Crime Agency and made a complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Mr Graham said Mr Cushnahan relinquished his shareholding in the bookmaking business in 2010 but kept a 5% shareholding in the Grahams' property businesses.
The loans held by those property businesses were later moved into Nama.
Mr Graham said that should have led to a declaration of interest by Mr Cushnahan when he became a Nama advisor.
Mr Cushnahan has previously said he did give up the property firm interests and that it was due to an ""administrative error"" that he was still listed as a shareholder.
Nama committee minutes seen by the BBC also show that Mr Cushnahan did make declarations of interests on a number of occasions.
Mr Graham is fighting a High Court battle in an attempt to win back control of his firms.
He told the committee that Cerberus had been ""ruthless, unjust and unreasonable"".
Earlier, the committee voted to call loyalist blogger and flag protestor Jamie Bryson to give evidence to its inquiry.
Mr Bryson has made allegations on social media regarding the deal and has written to the committee claiming to have relevant information.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) members of the committee and the Alliance Party's Judith Cochrane voted against calling him.
The DUP's Jim Wells said he opposed calling Mr Bryson as he could make ""even wilder allegations"" under committee privilege than the claims on his blogs.
Mrs Cochrane voted against on the basis that the committee needed to take further steps to ensure Mr Bryson's evidence remains with the inquiry's terms of reference.
The committee has been investigating the circumstances of the Nama deal after an allegation by Irish politician Mick Wallace that a Northern Ireland politician was in line for a Â£7m payment as a result of the transaction.

37799701,"For chief executive Somnath Saha, the economics of tea are simple and brutal.
Typhoo Tea produces 125 million tea bags a week at its factory in Moreton, Wirral, which have just one ingredient - tea leaves, and they are imported.
Black tea is a global commodity, traded in dollars. Following the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote, costs have soared for this renowned brand as 95% of its sales are in the UK.
""This is an absolute disaster for a company the size of ours,"" says Mr Saha.
""The very sharp fall in the pound means the impact is at least a quarter of a million pounds a month for us. This is having a very negative impact on our business and we are really suffering. It's now come to a point where it's not sustainable for us.""
The news comes amid warnings of rising prices in the grocery sector, and with supermarket chain Morrisons increasing the cost of a jar of Marmite by 12.5%.
There are plenty of winners from the fall in the value of sterling. But Typhoo Tea is a graphic illustration of what it's like for a business with one raw imported material.
Typhoo has been trading for more than a century. These days, most of its black tea comes from Kenya. It's then blended and packaged on site. The company also packages own-label tea for most of the major supermarkets.
In addition, it produces a range of herbal teas and those ingredients are sourced in euros.
It's a high-volume, low-margin business.
The cost of the ingredient depends on the quality of the leaf. A typical 80kg bag of black tea could be bought for £90 to £100 at the beginning of the year. The company says that same bag now costs £120 to £150 at the weekly international auctions.
In other words, it is paying an awful lot more for the same amount of tea.
""We don't have big enough margins between us and retailers to absorb all these costs. We're looking at how to mitigate some of them, from our labour, overheads and marketing costs, which will affect the growth of the business and employment in long run. But some of these currency costs will have to be passed on, as neither us nor the retailers can absorb any more cost increases,"" Mr Saha says.
Like other suppliers, he is in discussions with the supermarkets about price rises. He denies posturing to try to secure a better deal.
""Absolutely not. This is a really serious situation for us. Nobody wants to do this, but ultimately some of the costs will go to the shoppers. There is no other option,"" Mr Saha says.
""It's one of the favourite drinks of this country. It's very unfortunate. It's nobody's fault - it's due to the economic conditions.""
Typhoo Tea is owned by the Indian conglomerate Apeejay Surrendra Group, which Mr Saha says has supported the UK business for the last few months.
But he warned that if the fall in the pound was sustained, his business would be set to lose £3m, all but wiping out its profits. The time has now come to do something about it, he says.
""For everybody, it's been so difficult after June. We can't plan anything. Every day, you don't know what is going to happen next week. There is so much volatility.""
Typhoo employs some 300 workers in the UK.
Many suppliers are talking to the supermarkets about price rises. These negotiations are normally confidential but they spilled into the open when Tesco's spat with Unilever became public.
Retailers and suppliers regularly discuss prices but, according to one industry expert, the current situation is different.
""This is no cat and mouse game. What we've been seeing here is unprecedented,"" says David Sables from Sentinel Management Consultants, which advises suppliers on how to negotiate with supermarkets.
""The real change that's happened here is that it's happening at a time when the retailers' margins have been squeezed by the battle with Aldi and Lidl. They can't take any more pain. It comes with a price increase to them, they will have to pass it on.
""There needs to be a new approach, a getting together of everyone to sensibly sit down and see how they can protect the consumer against what is a real industry issue,"" he says.
There are ways to absorb costs. For instance, Tesco and Morrisons are trying to make their businesses more simple and efficient which will save money in the long run. Packaging and product sizes can also be reviewed.
But after years of falling prices in the aisles, it seems inevitable that some prices will rise.

12867786,"Maj Matthew Collins, 38, from Backwell, in Somerset, and L/Sgt Mark Burgan, 28, from Liverpool, died on Wednesday when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb.
Their commanding officer said their loss was ""a devastating blow"".
Their deaths take to 362 the total number of UK military personnel to have died in Afghanistan since 2001.
Maj Collins joined 1st Battalion Irish Guards and had also served in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Northern Ireland and Iraq.
He was the company commander of Number 3 Company, and leaves behind two children and his wife, Lucy.
His family said in a statement: ""Not only a soldier but a caring husband, devoted father to Freya and Charlie, caring son, wonderful brother and friend to many. We will all miss him and remember him always.""
L/Sgt Mark Burgan joined the Guards in 1999 and had also served in Northern Ireland and Iraq.
His wife, Leanne, said: ""I am so honoured to be Mark's wife. I will always love my hero.
""Mark was an extremely proud Irish Guardsman, dad, husband, brother and son. He will forever be in our hearts.""
The two men were returning to base from an operation aimed at disrupting insurgent groups in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb.
Lt Col Christopher Ghika, commanding officer of 1st Battalion Irish Guards, said: ""Two more committed and professional soldiers it would be hard to meet; they epitomised what it meant to be a member of this family regiment.""
He said Maj Collins had played a key role in training Afghan soldiers, adding: ""It is a telling fact that there is a deep sense of sorrow hanging over the 3rd Kandak of the Afghan Brigade today, such is the respect in which they held Matt Collins.""
Speaking about L/Sgt Burgan, Lt Col Ghika said: ""The notes given to me by his company commander, alongside whom he died, say it all: 'Knows what has to be done, does it brilliantly and has the next thing ready before you ask'.""
The commanding officer added: ""It is perhaps a comment on the character of this regiment that both Lucy Collins and Leanne Burgan are the daughters of distinguished and long serving Irish Guardsmen.
""The events of last night are a family tragedy in every sense.""
Defence Secretary Liam Fox said both were men ""of great experience and exemplary commitment"".
""They have laid down their lives protecting our national security, a loss made all the more poignant as they were so close to finishing their tour of duty and returning home,"" he said.",Two soldiers from 1st Battalion Irish Guards killed in Afghanistan just six days before they were due to return home have been named.
40741264,"A letter has been sent to all 45 elected members setting out Market Abuse Regulations.
They have been asked to sign the letter acknowledging the terms and return it to the authority's legal department.
It comes after the council became the first in Scotland to issue bonds on the stock exchange worth £370m.
That followed credit rating agency Moody's assigning Aberdeen an Aa2 rating.
It will be used to fund infrastructure projects including the new Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre (AECC) and the City Centre Masterplan.
The local authority said the bonds were less expensive than other available loans.
BBC Scotland understands that some councillors were initially concerned about the terms of the letter and whether it would impact on their ability to raise concerns publicly about the council's finances.
Insider dealing - where a person uses inside financial information to their benefit - is a criminal offence and is punishable by a heavy fine or imprisonment.
Market abuse is when someone can be given an unlimited fine for disclosing financial information that might affect the value of bonds and investments.
As well as councillors, senior officials at Aberdeen City Council are also included in the insiders list that must be disclosed to the Financial Conduct Authority on request.
An Aberdeen City Council spokesperson said: ""Aberdeen City Council successfully issued bonds on the London Stock Exchange in 2016 and as a result must comply with the Market Abuse Regulations.
""In line with these regulations, the council is obliged to keep a list of those individuals who have access to inside information.
""Elected members and staff who have been identified as having access to inside information relating to Aberdeen City Council have been notified in writing and asked to acknowledge receipt of that letter, which contains further detail of the insider list and its purpose.
""Training sessions on the Bond and compliance with associated regulations are under way for elected members and staff, underlining the responsibilities of the organisation and individuals. It should be stressed that the requirements for confidentiality in relation to specific subjects and issues are in line with the existing terms of employment and Councillors' Code of Conduct.
""The Bond issue was the subject of several reports to full Council in 2016, which outlined the implications of the public listing on the London Stock Exchange and made it clear it was highly likely all elected members would be on the Aberdeen City Council Insider List. These reports were considered and recommendations approved by elected members during full Council prior to the Bond issue.""
The council said that so far no one had refused to sign the letter, and councillors have been given until Friday to respond.
Currently all of Scotland's councillors are governed by a code of conduct.
In extreme cases, a councillor can be disqualified from office for five years for any breach.
Aberdeen City Councillors now face a potential police investigation if they are suspected of breaching Market Abuse Regulations.","Aberdeen councillors are being warned they face prison or fines if they break London Stock Exchange laws on insider dealing, BBC Scotland has learned."

Hull hammered Dyche's men 3-0 when the two sides last met on Boxing Day, but a repeat of that never looked likely with the hosts deserving their narrow win.
Barton came close to opening the scoring after half an hour when his skidding free-kick forced a low save from McGregor before the keeper denied the same player from a header.
The pivotal moment in the game came in the 77th minute when Wales international Vokes reacted quickest to McGregor's save from another Barton effort.
Hull substitute Chuba Akpom had a shot saved but he could not prevent his side suffering a first defeat since 28 December.

Hull manager Steve Bruce:
""There was loads of heart and endeavour out there, and that from two top-class teams. It was never going to be a classic in weather like that.
""We carved out some great chances, but maybe we just missed that killer instinct in front of goal that you need.
""We've lost, but you just have to accept the result and move on. And we will do.

37857729,"The teenager said James Comey's decision to publicise part of the FBI's investigation into Mr Weiner had led to her being hounded by news reporters.
Mr Comey announced last week that the investigation had turned up fresh emails relating to Hillary Clinton.
Mr Weiner is married to Mrs Clinton's political aide Huma Abedin.
In an open letter, the teenager said reporters had ""canvassed"" her area.
""Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my 'story'"", she wrote.
""Why couldn't your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the centre of attention the last week of the election cycle?""
She accused the FBI director of taking a ""vague approach"" in announcing that emails had been discovered on Mr Weiner's laptop that related to Mrs Clinton.
She said the lack of detail in his announcement led reporters to chase her for clues about what might have been found.
In the letter, addressed directly to Mr Comey and published by Buzzfeed, the alleged victim wrote: ""I am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner.
""I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators.""
She went on to say: ""I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I co-operated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters' phone calls and emails.
""I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election.

40041968,"There's no getting away from it - the big-screen adaptation of the 1990s TV series is simply two hours of pure entertainment.
The action sequences are huge, the soundtrack is awesome, and the people are ludicrously good looking.
But it's also just totally ridiculous, which may not surprise those who have seen the trailer. Or read the somewhat less-than-kind reviews.
Dwayne Johnson - the highest paid (and most annoyingly likeable) movie star in the world - takes the lead in the reboot as Mitch alongside Zac Efron, who plays Brody.
Kelly Rohrbach, Alexandra Daddario and Priyanka Chopra also star, and there are, most importantly, cameo appearances from David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson.
(I would've thought they'd want to keep those as a surprise, personally, but their names appear in giant letters at the beginning alongside the rest of the cast.)
But this incarnation of Baywatch is much more knowing and tongue-in-cheek than it was in Hasselhoff and Anderson's day.
The film itself is long - presumably to allow for the slow-motion button to be used to its full potential when any character is running down the shoreline.
Those who lived through the TV show will remember the appeal of such bouncy scenes, which were a key part of helping the series become a worldwide phenomenon.
And a phenomenon it was. Baywatch became the most-watched television show in the world at the time and represented a huge cultural shift.
Anderson was the embodiment of a look which rose to prominence in the 90s - skinny, blonde, and enhanced by plastic surgery.
But strangely, the show arguably also had a moral compass, which may help explain why it got its early evening slot on TV.
The lifeguards were portrayed as something of a family, working as a cohesive team and looking out for each other while saving lives.
A lot of the storylines felt wholesome and saw characters doing the ""right thing"" - an odd juxtaposition with the highly sexualised elements of the series.
Mitch's relationship with his son is a good example - Hasselhoff's character is seen as a model single father to Hobie, doing his best to raise him with good morals and life skills despite the absence of the boy's mother.
But in many other ways, Baywatch is rather problematic.
It goes without saying that, in real life, very few of us indeed look as good as the Baywatch lifeguards as they dash down the beach in their orange swimsuits.
The male characters played by Johnson and Efron are muscular to a borderline unhealthy degree, while the women are tanned, big-chested and and impossibly skinny.
Nearly 30 years on from the show's TV premiere, you'd like to think we've come further than still accepting these as beauty ideals.
Stars such as Lena Dunham and Sarah Hyland have started to hit back at ""body shaming"" in recent years - a term which barely existed when the TV show aired.
Social media has helped drive a movement of being proud of who you are and how you look, and there's now a bigger fightback against the concept of the ""perfect"" body than there ever was in the 90s.
But you get the impression that everyone involved in the project totally gets and even embraces how unrealistic some elements of Baywatch are.
And at least the film knows how to make fun of itself.
Mitch mocks Brody's boyband-level good looks throughout the film, referring to him invariably as ""One Direction"", ""Bieber"", and ""High School Musical"" instead of by his actual name.
And at one point, Brody tells Mitch that the concept of lifeguards investigating crimes ""sounds like an entertaining but far-fetched TV show"".
But does such a show still have a place in 2017? Realistically, it probably shouldn't.
We arguably should be over beautiful people running along a shoreline making immature jokes and getting involved in such obviously contrived storylines.
Since the TV series, life has happened. The internet has happened. Our tastes should have become more refined as the amount of choice available to consumers has exploded.
But Baywatch remains stupidly entertaining, one of those junk food films which is perfectly enjoyable provided you aren't going in expecting to see the next best picture winner.
You might feel guilty watching it, but the 2017 incarnation of Baywatch is, quite simply, unfiltered escapism - and there are far worse things in the world than that.
Baywatch is released in UK cinemas on 29 May.

Dumbarton's Craig Barr hit the crossbar with a second-half header but the Sons then had Andy Dowie sent off for two bookings.
Substitutes Nicky Clark and Andy Ryan added late goals to add gloss to the visitors' victory.
That is four wins on the bounce for Allan Johnston's men and on this form Dunfermline appear to be more than capable of sustaining a promotion challenge.
Of the six players playing in midfield or attack, only Nate Wedderburn really sits back. That security allowed Cardle, Higginbotham, Declan McManus, Dean Shiels and Callum Smith to roam forward in the first half.
Cardle converted at the back post after a messy scramble following good initial play down the right by McManus.
A superb counter-attack brought the Pars their second, as Higginbotham rolled the ball calmly into the far corner from a fairly tight angle.
Dumbarton nearly reduced the deficit, but Barr's header bounced off the woodwork after he had connected with Tom Walsh's corner.

Eleventh-placed Irish face Northampton on Saturday, looking for a first Premiership away win in almost a year.
""We'll be keen to stay in touch with them as much as possible,"" McCusker told BBC Radio Berkshire.
Irish sit level on points with fellow strugglers Newcastle ahead of the trip to Franklin's Gardens and will be keen to maintain the momentum of their recent home form.
""We've had some games recently where we've been in it or just behind at half-time,"" said McCusker.
""But in the second half we've had games where we've just capitulated and been a totally different team.
""If we let Northampton get too far ahead, they'll be buoyed by that.""
The former Scarlets captain left the Pro 12 club in September by mutual agreement as he joined Irish on an initial one-year deal.
Capped six times by his country, McCusker admitted the decision was driven by a need to play more games.
""I didn't really know how I'd ever leave,"" he said. ""But circumstances changed and it wasn't the place I had fallen in love with.
""So it made the decision a lot easier. It was probably the right time and felt like the right thing to do.""",London Irish number eight Rob McCusker believes confidence can flourish among his team-mates after their crucial Premiership victory against Worcester.
39321579,"Some firms said they could not recruit or retain the staff they needed.
The Local Government Association said it was the result of ""historic under-funding"" and an ageing population.
The government declined an interview but said English councils had received £9.25bn for social care.
The figure for the number of cancelled contracts comes from a Freedom of Information request, which was responded to by 197 of 212 UK councils.
According to the research, carried out for Panorama by Opus Restructuring and Company Watch, 69 home care companies have closed in the last three months and one in four of the UK's 2,500 home care companies is at risk of insolvency.
Councillor Izzi Seccombe from the Local Government Association - which represents councils across England and Wales - said: ""We have warned that the combination of the historic under-funding of adult social care, and the significant pressures of an ageing population and the national living wage, are pushing the care provider market to the brink of collapse.
""These figures show the enormous strain providers are under, and emphasises the urgent need for a long-term, sustainable solution to the social care funding crisis.""
Many home care companies say their biggest problem is recruitment and retention of carers.
The Centre for Workforce Intelligence estimates at least two million more carers will be needed by 2025 in England alone, in both in-home care and care homes, to cope with growing demand.
Last October, the regulator for England, the Care Quality Commission, warned that adult social care was at a tipping point.
One home care company, Cymorth Llaw, which had contracts with three councils in north Wales, told Panorama it had recently stopped working with one - Conwy, which had initially paid £14.20 an hour for care.
It offered to raise that to £15, but the company decided that still wasn't enough and handed back the contract.
Ken Hogg, at Cymorth Llaw, said: ""We didn't think we could do it for the money - it was as simple as that.
""We pay as much [in wages] as we possibly can and we've always paid above what was the national minimum wage and the national living wage.
""[Carers] get a mileage allowance, they get paid travelling time between their clients.""
Mr Hogg said the company was legally obliged to pay 1% pension and 13.8% national insurance contributions, along with training and other staff-associated costs, which ""doesn't leave a great deal"".
Conwy Council said it was committed to supporting vulnerable people in communities, despite the financial challenges.
Home care company Mears used to have a contract with Liverpool City Council but cancelled it in July, saying £13.10 an hour was not enough to cover costs.
Mears said it needed at least £15 an hour, and like other companies across the UK, argued its costs are often greater than what councils pay.
Alan Long, executive director at Mears, said: ""That was a terrible thing to do for both service users and for care staff.
""We absolutely did not take that lightly, but frankly what choice did we have?
""We just cannot do the two most basic things that you need to do in home care - pay staff the absolute minimum of a living wage and be able to recruit enough people to deliver the service that Liverpool Council actually expected from us.""
The industry's trade body, the United Kingdom Homecare Association, said many companies were really struggling.
Colin Angel, its policy and campaigns director, said some care providers are ""really desperate"" and ""really do not know whether they're going to be able to continue in business, beyond the next year"".
He added: ""That means they're really having to make some hard commercial decisions, whether they might need to cease trading or indeed just hand back work to local councils.""
The nationwide shortage of carers is leaving many elderly people stuck in NHS wards, which results in bed blocking.
Government figures show there are more than 6,500 people across Britain stuck in an acute hospital bed, despite being well enough to leave.
In England, a third of these are waiting for a home care package.
Mike Furlong, manager of the Granby Rehabilitation Unit in Liverpool, told Panorama that while on average people spend 28 days at the care facility, ""some patients have been with us 12 and 14 weeks because all the therapy is complete, but unfortunately there's no care package available at the end of it"".
Liverpool City Council said that, over the last seven years, its budget had been cut by £330m and it now needed to find a further £90m over the next three years.
Samih Kalakeche, Liverpool's director of adult social services, said: ""Is there a crisis in the home care services? I'll say yes, there is - and it's not just money, it's the sheer volume of demographics.
""We've got an ageing population which we welcome, but we don't have enough people coming into the industry.""
Earlier this month, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced £2bn extra for social care for English councils over the next three years.
Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales will decide how they spend their extra funding.
But the industry says that with an increasingly ageing population, it's just not enough to keep pace with demand.
The government has said it will be bringing forward more proposals later this year, to ensure a financially sustainable social care system.

41091563,"State media also repeated threats to the US Pacific island of Guam, which it called ""an advanced base of invasion"".
The missile launched on Tuesday crossed Japan's northern Hokkaido island, triggering public alerts to take cover, before landing in the sea.
The UN Security Council has unanimously condemned North Korea for its actions.
Meeting late on Tuesday in New York, the council called the launch ""outrageous"", demanding North Korea cease all missile testing.
While the statement said the regime's actions were a threat to all UN member states, it did not threaten new sanctions against Pyongyang.
Russia and China said US military activity in the region was partly to blame for the increase in tensions, and urged negotiations.
Arriving for a visit to Japan, British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday called on China to put more pressure on North Korea, saying that Beijing had a key role in the international response to Pyongyang's ""reckless provocation"".
North Korea has repeatedly conducted missile launches in recent months, despite being barred from doing so under UN rules.
The latest, a domestically made Hwasong-12, was launched early on Tuesday Korean time from a site near Pyongyang.
It travelled some 2,700km (1,678 miles), at an unusually low height for North Korean missile tests, over Hokkaido before crashing about 1,180km off Japan's eastern coast.
Japan sent out alerts telling people in Hokkaido to take cover. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe later called it ""unprecedented, serious and a grave threat"".
For the first time, North Korea's official news agency KCNA admitted deliberately firing a ballistic missile across Japan. Previous projectiles which crossed the mainland were later claimed to have been satellite launches.
It said the launch was in direct response to joint US-South Korean military drills which are currently taking place, as well as to mark the anniversary of the Japan-Korea treaty of 1910, which saw Japanese forces annex the Korean peninsula.
KCNA, quoting leader Kim Jong-un, said that, ""like a real war"", the latest drill was ""the first step of the military operation of the KPA [Korean People's Army] in the Pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing Guam"".
Mr Kim has also ordered more rocket drills targeting the region, it said.
North Korea first threatened to fire missiles towards Guam - a major US military centre in the Pacific and where some 160,000 US citizens live - earlier this month.
US officials had suggested that the fact it had not carried out its threat so far was a sign of possible progress.
US President Donald Trump, in a statement released by the White House, said the world had ""received North Korea's latest message loud and clear"".
""This regime has signalled its contempt for its neighbours, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behaviour,"" he said.
""Threatening and destabilising actions only increase the North Korean regime's isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table.""
Earlier this month, President Trump warned Pyongyang would face ""fire and fury"" if it continued to threaten the US.
Have North Korea's missile tests paid off?","North Korea says its firing of a missile over Japan was ""the first step"" of military operations in the Pacific, signalling plans for more launches."

Wes Hoolahan gave the Republic a deserved lead shortly after half-time with a crisply struck half-volley worthy of opening the scoring in any match.
Martin O'Neill's team had struck the woodwork and gone close several times prior to scoring.
But, after taking the lead they found themselves under increasing pressure and conceded when Clark, chosen ahead of Richard Keogh in the centre of defence, headed a low cross from Zlatan Ibrahimovic into his own net.
The equaliser came from one of the few moments of quality from the Sweden captain, who collected a neat backheel from substitute John Guidetti and raced to the byeline before drilling in a low cross.
Jeff Hendrick drew a late save from Andreas Isaksson but there was to be no winner at the end of a feisty, scrappy match the Republic shaded but could not close out.
Commitment, passion and determination were much in evidence at the Stade de France, with those workmanlike qualities comfortably eclipsing any quality and finesse on show.
But, in the end, neither side had quite enough to prevail and are left to ponder a result that is hardly disastrous but not exactly what either wanted.
Both have remaining Group E fixtures against Italy and Belgium - the two favourites to progress - and have arguably missed out on their best chance to get a crucial victory.
In a tournament with 16 qualifiers from the group stage, three points would have taken one of them a huge step towards reaching the next round.

The Republic lost all three of their games at Euro 2012, when Italian coach Giovanni Trapattoni set up his team to try to stymie their opponents and snatch the points.
Yet after qualifying from a group that included Poland and Germany, there was no lack of adventure and ambition here in Paris.
Robbie Brady was a menace down the left, Hendrick struck the crossbar with a caressed right-foot strike and drew a superb save with a crisp shot from the edge of the area, and John O'Shea was inches from converting Clark's flick-on.
There was also no disputing the quality of Hoolahan's goal three minutes after the restart.
Seamus Coleman delivered a superb cross after a teasing, jinking run down the right and Hoolahan, who had found space at a premium in a generally congested midfield, superbly smashed home a half-volley from 14 yards across goal and beyond Isaksson.
Hendrick forced another save from the Sweden goalkeeper with a low strike after his team conceded and the men in green showed enough to suggest that whatever happens to them in this tournament they will leave everything on the field.
Ibrahimovic said before the match that ""the legend can still deliver"", but it did not look like it for most of the match. On many occasions - especially during the first half - the 34-year-old was drawn so deep in search of the ball that he looked more like a midfielder.
Ibrahimovic, strongly linked with Manchester United, scored 11 of his team's 19 goals in qualifying, and going into the fixture with the Republic might have fancied his prospects against a central-defensive pairing of O'Shea and Clark.
Yet he had very little chance to improve on his record of 62 international goals. He struck the wall with a free-kick, snatched a volley and was inches from converting a low drilled cross.
But he was at the heart of the move that led to the equaliser.
The unfortunate Clark had already gone close once to putting the ball in his own net with a header Darren Randolph did well to save before Emil Forsberg hammered the rebound wide.
But Randolph could do nothing to stop Clark's header after Ibrahimovic had finally sprung to life and at least partially justified his top billing.
Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill: ""I thought we were magnificent in the game with some really great football.
""Of course the goal deflates you and there is disappointment in the dressing room, but I don't think the players should be downhearted with their performance.
""I think they should be absolutely thrilled with the way we played.""
Goalscorer Wes Hoolahan: ""The boys were unlucky but we'll take the point. We created a lot of chances.
""In the first half we were excellent and at the start of the second as well. The boys should be proud of themselves, it's a great point in the end.""

34409397,"The move earlier this year sparked widespread public and political backlash with many questioning whether the British royal deserved Australia's top honour.
It came after Mr Abbot revived Australia's honours system last year.
The new cabinet under Malcolm Turnbull is set to review the honours system.
Mr Turnbull, the new prime minister, ousted Mr Abbott from power in an internal party challenge last month.
On 26 January - Australia's national day - Mr Abbott announced he had nominated Queen Elizabeth II's husband to receive the knighthood.
He had said then that the Duke of Edinburgh's life of ""service and dedication"" should be honoured. The Queen awarded the knighthood in April.
Asked on Thursday in an interview with radio station 3AW about his decision, Mr Abbott said: ""Obviously it was an injudicious appointment.""
Australia's honours system
The move was met with scorn from many among the Australian public, who questioned the Prince's contributions to Australia and pointed out that as a British royal he was a symbol of another country.
Some media outlets called it a ""Knightmare"", opposition leader Bill Shorten called it ""anachronistic"", and Mr Abbott faced criticism from within his own Liberal party.
Mr Turnbull, who used to chair Australia's republican movement, had previously defended the honours system's revival in 2014, noting that most republics have an honours system and an order of knighthood.
But he is now said to be in favour of abolishing the system, according to Australian media reports.","Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said his decision to award Prince Philip a knighthood was ""injudicious""."

But between travel companies' elevated school holiday prices and the need to juggle work commitments, some parents say they cannot always go away during the school holidays and that it should be their decision to make.
Hayley, 39, says she is ""fuming"" at the ruling.
Together with her husband Martin, the couple, from Cheshire, took their children Archie, aged five, and Ruby, six, out of school in January to attend a family wedding in India.
As Archie was under five at the time, his absence did not cause problems. But Ruby's did.
Not long after they returned, letters arrived from the local council to inform them that they were being fined a total of Â£120.
""I'm not going to pay it,"" she said. ""They basically brandish you a criminal.""
Hayley had asked the school for permission but says she never received a reply.
""Why should you be dictated to?"" she said.
""It's made no difference to Ruby. She's never missed anything important.
""India was such a different country to go to. It taught them things. It was such a good experience.""
Hayley is frustrated by what she sees as inconsistencies in the enforcement of the rules.
""Some children have a really bad attendance but don't get fined. Ruby's attendance was close to 100%.
""We took work on the plane and I encouraged her to do writing and reading while we were away.""
There has been criticism that the rule does not allow enough discretion for people's individual circumstances.

""I haven't been able to go away during the summer break since my children were born."" Harry, his eldest, is nine and Samuel is five.
With his partner Laura, Marcus took his children out of school for two weeks in October to visit Disney World in Florida.
""It was a very special one,"" he said. ""The memories will last for a lifetime.
""They swam with dolphins and Harry came back with loads of knowledge about dolphins.""
But the school recorded the absence as unauthorised leave and Marcus is worried they may now be fined.
""They sympathised with my situation but said that they could not risk getting into trouble authorising it,"" he said.
""My children have high attendance rates and I understand the need to prevent unnecessary absence, but if you make the children do a diary and read while on holiday then I honestly do not see the harm going during term-time.""
Though the Supreme Court ruling might make Marcus think twice about taking his children out of school to go on holiday, he does not think it would stop him.
""I feel I deserve time with my children away from work, school and day-to-day pressures.
""I feel holidays provide this space to relax and enjoy time together, to explore other countries, cultures and ways of life.
""I do not feel that taking time out is jeopardising my children's education, if anything it brings greater variety to it.""

Other ceremonies for veterans are being held in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness before Remembrance Sunday.
From 1941 to 1945, Allied ships sailed from Scotland and Iceland to Russia to supply it with food and weapons.
More than 3,000 seamen lost their lives to the freezing conditions and attacks by German submarines and aircraft.
In total, 214 Ushakov Medals are being presented by the Consul General Andrey Pritsepov to veterans or their families in Scotland.
The Consul General said: ""The Ushakov Medal is one of Russia's most important naval awards, presented only to those who demonstrated courage in sea warfare.
""These medals are well-deserved by the Scottish veterans of the Arctic Convoys who sailed alongside our fathers and grandfathers on extremely dangerous missions and returned home victorious against all odds.""
The ceremony at Glasgow City Chambers on Friday is being hosted by Lord Provost Sadie Docherty.
She said: ""In this centenary year of the outbreak of the First World War, we are remembering the fallen in all conflicts and the bravery of those who defend our shores and freedoms.
""Those who served in the notorious Arctic Convoys have a special place in history and we owe them a huge debt for their bravery and tenacity.
""I know it means a great deal to the veterans and their families that they are finally being honoured in this fashion for their role in maintaining a vital naval lifeline that helped Britain and her allies win the war.""
The medal is named after Fyodor Ushakov, an 18th Century naval commander who never lost a battle and the patron saint of the Russian navy.
The medal was originally established in 1944 for those who demonstrated courage and prowess in sea warfare.
It is now awarded to veterans ""for personal courage and valour shown during World War Two while participating in the Arctic Convoys"".
Convoys left the Clyde and Loch Ewe in Wester Ross during the effort to supply Russia with food and weapons from 1941 to 1945.
The British Merchant Navy, along with Russian, US, Canadian, Norwegian and Dutch merchant fleets, were involved.

34441724,"The remains of this large, rodent-like creature give clues about how mammals ""took over"" when dinosaurs died out.
They think the newly-discovered species was a plant-eating creature that looked a bit like a beaver.
The researchers noticed, in particular, the animal's teeth, which were designed for chewing plants.
This group of now-extinct mammals lived alongside the dinosaurs and thrived for more than 100 million years.
The scientists say that this discovery helps explain how mammals made it through the event which killed off dinosaurs, thought to be an asteroid hitting Earth.
""A whole lot of mammals did die, but this group is one that made it through pretty well,"" Dr Brusatte explained.
""That asteroid hit and suddenly the dinosaurs are wiped out. It looks like mammals were just waiting their turn and as soon as the dinosaurs disappeared, they thrived.""",Scientists have discovered a species of ancient mammal that survived the event that led to the end of the dinosaurs.

And it is understood that they would seek financial assistance from the Scottish government.
The facial recognition system was mentioned at a meeting of all 42 clubs on Tuesday.
The debate over the extent to which clubs should be held accountable for the conduct of their followers has been sparked by recent incidents involving Rangers, Celtic and Dundee United supporters.
Hibernian's visit to Ibrox on 28 December was marred by sectarian chants from the home end, while there were complaints of sectarian songs during Celtic's Scottish Cup trip to Stranraer.
Celtic and Dundee United have both condemned their own fans for setting off pyrotechnics.
SPFL board member Mike Mulraney revealed there was not appetite to introduce new strict liability rules.
The Alloa chairman said there is ""no chance whatsoever"" of clubs agreeing to regulations that could see them punished for the conduct of supporters regardless of whether the club itself is to blame.
A spokesman for the league body said: ""The SPFL is working with government and other partners with the aim of establishing a workable solution to help rid our football grounds of unacceptable conduct.
""This work is at an early stage and is not being led by any one club.
""The issue of unacceptable conduct is something that the SPFL, its board and its member clubs are absolutely committed to addressing.
""Recognising that certain behaviours are for society to face and address as a whole, we believe football can take a leading role in moving this issue forward for Scottish society.""
The prospect of facial recognition technology has been met with scepticism from the Scottish Football Supporters' Association.
Chairman Simon Barrow said the fans' group is concerned by ""a rushed move towards intrusive surveillance"".
He added: ""There needs to be careful consultation with fans and clubs, alongside wider consideration of how to deal effectively and proportionately with threatening and insulting behaviour.
""The best way forward will involve working with the great majority of supporters who deplore such abuses, rather than making them feel under accusation themselves.""",The Scottish Professional Football League is considering the use of facial recognition technology at stadiums to help combat anti-social behaviour.
36797539,"Sadie Hartley, 60, was stunned with a cattle prod and stabbed at her home in Helmshore, Lancashire, in January.
Preston Crown Court heard Sarah Williams, 35, exchanged naked photographs with Ms Hartley's partner Ian Johnston in the weeks prior to the death.
Ms Williams denies murder.
The court has heard Ms Williams was obsessed by Mr Johnston, 57, and ""eliminated"" Ms Hartley with the help of Katrina Walsh, 56,  who also denies murder, when he refused to leave her.
Mr Johnston, who had been in an ""intermittent"", ""intimate"" relationship with communications director Ms Hartley, began a sexual relationship with Ms Williams after they met in December 2012.
The former firefighter told Ms Williams the relationship was over months later, he said, but she kept contacting him in person or by text and even sent an anonymous letter to Ms Hartley, boasting the sender had had ""fantastic"" sex with Mr Johnston.
John McDermott, prosecuting, said Mr Johnston and Ms Williams exchanged naked photographs on 3, 4 and 5 December last year.
Mr Johnston said he didn't block the messages and responded ""in kind"" to Ms Williams' messages.
But he told the prosecutor he did not seek to rekindle the relationship and was ""distraught"" when he read the texts the next day.
There were further similar exchanges between the pair on Christmas Day, and again 10 days before the murder, Mr McDermott told the court.
Mr Johnston had been in Switzerland when the messages in January were sent, the court heard.
Mr McDermott asked: ""What were your intentions with Sarah Williams once you would return to this country?""
Mr Johnston said: ""Nothing at all. I can't recall half the text messages.""
Ms Williams and riding instructor Katrina Walsh, 56, of Hare Lane, Chester, both deny murder.

Families work with police, the health service, voluntary sector and council to avoid violence at home.
Ms Henry-Leach said parents were often reluctant to get help.
""They feel shame and stigma attached to being a victim of domestic abuse, while also fearing the consequences for their child if reported,"" she said.
The programme seeks to stop children moving from one abusive relationship to another, using a ""whole-family approach"" unique to Doncaster to build families' self-esteem and resilience, Ms Henry-Leach said.
Many teenagers on the programme have lived with domestic violence between parents so the project attempts to ""de-normalise"" abuse and help them move on to healthier relationships.
Mother and son, Anne and Luke (not their real names) from Doncaster, said the techniques derived from University of Oxford research taught them how to listen.
""There was a lot of swearing and abusive behaviour before,"" Anne said.  ""Luke never actually hit me, but he'd go to hit me, or push me which could be frightening.
""I can now sit down and talk to my son without us shouting at each other. We can actually have a conversation without being abusive.

The incident took place on a creek near the village of Sisco, Upper Corsica.
Tension has grown this summer between local communities and Muslims of North African origin in the south of France, especially following the massacre of 85 people by a lorry driver in the city of Nice on 14 July.

French media report that the trouble began around 18:15 (16:15 GMT) when tourists took photos of women bathing. Reports say the women were wearing burkinis.
Ange Vivoni, mayor of Sisco, told reporters that when a local teenager was stabbed, the victim's ""family and all the people of Sisco got together"".
According to the newspaper Le Figaro (in French), some of the older men in the bathing party had attacked a group of local teenagers on the beach with hatchets.
When the teenagers' parents arrived from the village, two of them were reportedly injured with harpoons. Villagers allegedly then set alight cars belonging to the bathers.

6 - 8 July 1995: Bosnian Serb forces had laid siege to the Srebrenica enclave, where tens of thousands of civilians had taken refuge from earlier Serb offensives in north-eastern Bosnia.
They were under the protection of about 600 lightly armed Dutch infantry forces. Fuel was running out and no fresh food had been brought into the enclave since May.
Serb forces began shelling Srebrenica. Bosnian Muslim fighters in the town asked for the return of weapons they had surrendered to the peacekeepers but their request was refused.
The Dutch commander called UN Headquarters in Sarajevo asking for ""close air support"" after shells and rockets landed close to refugee centres and observation posts manned by peacekeepers.
9 July 1995: The Bosnian Serbs stepped up their shelling and thousands of refugees fled to the town from southern camps ahead of advancing Serbs, who attacked Dutch observation posts, taking about 30 soldiers hostage.
One peacekeeper was fatally wounded when Bosnian Muslims fired on retreating Dutch troops.
10 July 1995: Dutch Commander Col Karremans filed a request for UN air support after the Bosnian Serbs shelled Dutch positions. UN Commander Gen Janvier initially refused, but agreed after another request from the colonel. Serb attacks stopped before the planes arrived and strikes were postponed.
Some 4,000 refugees were in the town by the evening and there was panic on the streets. Large crowds were gathered around the Dutch positions.
The Dutch commander told town leaders that Nato planes would launch massive air attacks against the Serbs if they had not withdrawn from the safe area by 06:00 the following morning.
11 July 1995: The Serb forces did not withdraw, but at 09:00 Col Karremans received word from Sarajevo that his request for close air support had been submitted on the wrong form. At 10:30, the resubmitted request reached Gen Janvier, but Nato planes had to return to base in Italy to refuel after being airborne since 06:00. By midday, more than 20,000 refugees - mostly women, children and the infirm - fled to the main Dutch base at Potocari.
At 14:30, two Dutch F-16 fighters dropped two bombs on Serb positions surrounding Srebrenica. The Serbs responded with a threat to kill their Dutch hostages and shell refugees, causing the suspension of further strikes.
The Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic entered Srebrenica two hours later, accompanied by Serb camera crews. In the evening, Gen Mladic summoned Col Karremans to a meeting at which he delivered an ultimatum that the Muslims must hand over their weapons to guarantee their lives.
12 July 1995: Buses arrived to take women and children to Muslim territory, while the Serbs begin separating out all males from age 12 to 77 for ""interrogation for suspected war crimes"".
It is estimated that 23,000 women and children were deported in the next 30 hours. Hundreds of men were held in trucks and warehouses.
About 15,000 Bosnian Muslim fighters had attempted to escape from Srebrenica overnight and were shelled as they fled through the mountains.
13 July 1995: The first killings of unarmed Muslims took place in a warehouse in the nearby village of Kravica.
Peacekeepers handed over about 5,000 Muslims who had been sheltering at the Dutch base at Potocari. In return, the Bosnian Serbs released 14 Dutch peacekeepers who had been held at the Nova Kasaba base.
16 July 1995: Early reports of massacres emerged as the first survivors of the long march from Srebrenica began to arrive in Muslim-held territory.
Following negotiations between the UN and the Bosnian Serbs, the Dutch were at last permitted to leave Srebrenica, leaving behind weapons, food and medical supplies.
In the five days after Bosnian Serb forces overran Srebrenica, more than 7,000 Muslim men are thought to have been killed.","In the summer of 1995, two years after being designated a United Nations Safe Area, the Bosnian town of Srebrenica became the scene of the worst massacre in the Bosnian war."

At Badgeworth, the tiny nature reserve boasts a small crop of the plant but in South Gloucestershire the buttercup is only spotted once every five years.
Plant expert Richard Lansdown said: ""We wouldn't normally reintroduce but Inglestone is down to a single plant.""
The species, more commonly known as the Badgeworth buttercup, relies on bare, wet ground that has been churned up by cattle to set seed and thrive.
But with fewer animals grazing the common in recent years, it has become overrun with scrub and the buttercup now ""only grows intermittently"" at a single pond.
""I sieved out the mud and extracted all the seeds [at Inglestone] and didn't find any from the Badgeworth buttercup - there weren't any left at all,"" said Mr Lansdown.
""So we've had to use seed originally collected from the site some years ago that was sent to the Millennium Seed Bank.""
Using the 270 plus seeds held at Kew, 200 plants were propagated and about 80 planted out at Inglestone with a further planting planned for mid-June
""The two sites have been declining for a very, very long time,"" said Mr Lansdown.
""But we've planted out 83 plants in different locations at Inglestone and at least half of them are surviving and doing well and have begun fruiting which will add to the seed bank.""",A rare buttercup is being reintroduced in South Gloucestershire.

I've already heard shouts and cries of 'April' as the search resumed this morning.
I'm standing near the spot where the five-year-old was last seen around half past seven on Monday evening.
The community has really pulled together and that was clear last night.
A few hundred people gathered at the town's leisure centre.
I was there to watch them come together. They divided themselves into groups to go out into the town to keep searching for April.
This morning, I've spoken to the local councillors who have said they will do everything possible to help April Jones's family at this very, very difficult time.
They've described the family as a wonderful family who play their part in the community, and they'll do everything they can to help find April safe and sound.
""We've got specially trained family liaison officers supporting April's family.""
He also praised the ""tremendous response"" from the community.
Local people gathered at Machynlleth Leisure Centre on Monday evening to help look for the girl, as news of her disappearance spread on social network sites.
Posters of April were also circulated and put up around the town.
Police also set up road blocks to check vehicles, while the street where April disappeared has been cordoned off.
Det Ch Supt Simon Powell of Dyfed-Powys Police said officers were ""becoming increasingly concerned for her safety"".
He said the force had launched an ""intensive search and criminal investigation"" into the abduction.
""April was last seen playing on a bicycle near her home address and was seen getting into what we believe was a light-coloured van which then drove off,"" he added.
Insp Kevin Davies said the fire service and police dog teams had been mobilised, and vehicle check-points set up.
""There is mention of a grey van, we're looking at that as one of the angles of inquiry,"" he said. ""Nothing is being overlooked. It's an angle, it's an inquiry that we're pursuing along with other angles.
""We're searching the area.  Everything we can possibly do is being done.
""The family are obviously distressed. We're trying to keep them informed, we've got an officer allocated to them just to keep them informed as to what's happening. Any information, we'll share with them.""
Shadow Welsh Secretary, Owen Smith MP, told the Labour conference in Manchester that the thoughts and prayers of all delegates are with the missing girl and her family.
""We all pray she's back in her community and with her family as soon as humanly possible,"" he added.
Meanwhile, Powys County Council said it was providing support for pupils and staff at April's school. Both the primary school and adjacent secondary school are open with lessons continuing as usual.
The council said refuse and recycling collections in the town had been suspended for the day, with the workers involved volunteering to join in the police search.
Machynlleth, an historic market town in countryside in the Dyfi Valley, has a population of around 2,100.
Search volunteer Anwen Morris said locals had searched an area with a 30-mile radius overnight using quad bikes and off-road vehicles.
Local people described the family as ""very well liked"" and said they had helped create a community garden on the town's Bryn-y-Gog estate, which has more than 100 homes.
Alun Hughes, a friend of the family, said: ""We were out last night and at the moment we are waiting for the police to organise specialist searches of the town.""
Brian Vaughn, whose daughter goes to school with April, described her as a ""lovely little girl"". He said: ""Everybody just wants her back, really.
""Whatever we've got to do, we'll do it. We're just hoping for the best, that she's closer rather than further away.""
Mayor of Machenlleth Gareth Jones, who was among those at the leisure centre, said people wanted to help the search in any way they could.
""We're all shocked, and it's the uncertainty of it all as well of course which is really worrying,"" he said.
""Our thoughts go out to the family, the close family and friends of April.
""We're all here to help as you can see by the amount of people we've got here this evening.
""Anything we can do, we will do it.""
Machynlleth town councillor Michael Williams said people were ""stunned"".
Machynlleth is a quiet Powys market town.
Tourism is the town's major employment sector, with the countryside, along with its proximity to the coast, attracting people from across the UK.
Caravan and camping sites are dotted across the rural landscape and its rural setting and relatively slow pace of life has led to many visitors choosing to settle there in search of an alternative lifestyle.
The town, with its weekly market, remains one of the Welsh-speaking heartlands.
Crime is low with an average of 15 crimes a month reported in Machynlleth so far this year,  mostly for anti-social behaviour.
""I've lived here all my life and I've never heard of anything like this before,"" he said.
""The family must be devastated, and I hope to goodness the little girl is found without any huge delay.
Neighbour Rhydian Mason said: ""Most of us I think have found out through social networking sites online like Facebook - that's where I first heard of it - and we all want to see what we can do to help.
""It's completely heartbreaking. I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of April's parents and it's an awful feeling in the pit of the stomach. We're all out here hopefully to see if we can get a positive outcome to this story, and we'll do our best even if we're out all night.""

More than 1.6 million people are also displaced within South Sudan, meaning about 20% of the population have been made homeless since December 2013.
A fragile peace deal signed last year is on the brink of collapse.
""The violence in July came as a major setback to peace efforts in South Sudan,"" the UNHCR spokesman Leo Dobbs  said in a statement.
The UN says more than 185,000 people have fled South Sudan since July.
""The fighting has shattered hopes for a real breakthrough and triggered new waves of displacement and suffering, while humanitarian organisations are finding it very difficult for logistical, security and funding reasons to provide urgent protection and assistance to the hundreds of thousands in need,"" Mr Dobbs said.
South Sudan refugees:
Many of the refugees arriving in Uganda, which hosts the most South Sudanese, are ""exhausted after days walking in the bush and going without food or water. Many children have lost one or both of their parents"", the UNHCR says.
A fall-out between President Salva Kiir and former Vice-President Machar - the most powerful members of their respective Dinka and Nuer ethnic groups - led to the civil war which erupted in December 2013.
They only agreed to settle their differences under intense international pressure, signing a peace deal in August 2015 - and Mr Machar returned to Juba as vice-president in a unity government in April.
But battles then broke out between his bodyguards and presidential guards three months later, prompting him to flee.
Another member of his party has been appointed as vice-president, a move Mr Machar does not recognise.
Earlier this week, a report funded by George Clooney accused both Mr Kiir and Mr Machar, as well as their officials, of personally profiting from the war. Both men have denied the allegations.
The UN wants to deploy a 4,000-strong regional protection force for Juba which would have a more robust mandate than the 12,000 UN soldiers already in the country, however the mandate and size of the force still have to be agreed.

37469875,"Addressing the party's UK conference, Ms Dugdale restated her support for the tax policy her party ran on in May.
She wants a 50p tax on those earning over £150,000, and a penny increase in income tax to pay for public services.
The conference will vote on Tuesday on plans to give the Scottish and Welsh leaders more power over their parties.
The proposals would allow Kezia Dugdale and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones the power to appoint a representative to the party's UK national executive committee (NEC).
The plans would also give the Scottish and Welsh parties more autonomy.
Sources have said there was an attempt to ""unpick"" the plans by removing the extra seats from the package. This was defeated, but it is possible there could be a second attempt prior to Tuesday's vote.
Speaking at the weekend, Len McCluskey, head of the UK's biggest trade union Unite, said Ms Dugdale should not have the power to appoint Scotland's representative on the NEC.
He said that while there was wide support for the autonomy proposals, coupling them with the NEC seat plans had created a ""difficult position"".
Ms Dugdale has said she is confident the full package will be passed.
It appears Kezia Dugdale and Jeremy Corbyn are involved in their first dispute since his re-election.
A series of reforms to the way the Labour Party works are due to be passed on Tuesday.
The package includes autonomy plans praised by Ms Dugdale last week. This part is uncontroversial and supported by everyone I've spoken to.
But there is a row over another part. The reforms would also allow Ms Dugdale - and her Welsh counterpart Carwyn Jones - to appoint someone to represent them on the party's UK executive.
Mr Corbyn's supporters think the extra NEC seats could be used to try and undermine him as the battle for the party's future plays out. They want to postpone the plan.
For now, it appears Ms Dugdale will get her way. But it's possible there will be another attempt to scupper the NEC plan tomorrow.
In her address to the conference in Liverpool on Monday afternoon, the Scottish Labour leadersaid her party will not support ""another austerity budget"" in Scotland.
The speech is Ms Dugdale's first to conference since the Holyrood elections earlier this year, when Labour fell to third place in terms of the seats it holds in the Scottish parliament, behind the Conservatives.
MSPs at Holyrood will be responsible for setting income tax in Scotland from April 2017, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already rejected increasing the basic rate for the five year lifetime of the parliament, as well as ruling out upping the top rate in the first year.
Ms Dugdale said her party would ""place amendments to introduce a 50p tax on those earning over £150,000 and to add a penny to income tax to pay for public services"" when the Scottish government brings forward its budget for 2017-18.
She said: ""With the full range of powers the Scottish Parliament now has, the SNP government faces a clear choice.
""Accept a Tory budget from Westminster, or go our own way with proposals to grow the Scottish economy and protect our schools and hospitals.
""If the SNP minority government do not accept these proposals, and try to force another austerity budget through Holyrood, we will vote against it.
""If they want support, they'll need to look to the Tories for that. Labour will not help the SNP pass an austerity budget.""
Ms Dugdale also attacked Ms Sturgeon over her stance on independence, saying Scottish Labour would not support a second referendum during the current Holyrood term.
She said: ""We do not need the risk and uncertainty of another independence referendum.
""As we face negotiations on our membership of the EU and real threats to the future of our public services, we cannot afford our government to take their eye off the ball.
""With so many challenges facing Scotland in the future, we should not return to the divisions of the past.
""My message to Nicola Sturgeon is this: first minister, our country is already divided enough. Do not divide us again.""",Scottish Labour Leader Kezia Dugdale has pledged to oppose the Scottish government's budget if it does not embrace a 50p top rate of tax.

""We are monitoring the situation. We are definitely taking account of the number there and who is there,"" she said.
Meanwhile, face-to-face negotiations between Syrian government and opposition delegations in Geneva have been adjourned for the day.
A second round of peace talks was held on Monday with separate meetings between UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and the two sides.
""The beginning of this week is as laborious as it was in the first week. We are not making much progress,"" he told a news conference at the United Nations headquarters.
The first round ended last month with no firm agreements and both sides trading insults.
The opposition wants the government to commit in writing to the 2012 Geneva Communique, which called for the formation of a transitional administration with full executive authority.
President Bashar al-Assad's government has ruled out any transfer of power.
On the ground, efforts to evacuate hundreds more women, children and elderly people from Homs, which has been under siege for 18 months, were temporarily halted on Tuesday for logistical reasons.
More than 450 civilians left on Monday, amid mortar fire and shooting.

So their fate is being scrutinised very closely, our correspondent adds.
She was at a press conference on Tuesday where the Homs governor gave the latest figures on how many detainees had been released.
He said he expected around 80% of those held would be let free.
Matthew Hollingworth, Syria director for the UN's World Food Programme, told the BBC ""the floodgates have opened"" as many more people try to leave.
""The levels of destitution inside the Old City are like nothing I've ever seen before,"" he said.

But she also confirmed that 11 people were killed after the relief operation was ""deliberately targeted"". It is unclear who was responsible for the attack.
She said that many of those who had left the city so far appeared traumatised and weak after enduring many months of siege.
Writing in the UK's Independent newspaper, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague warned that the Srebrenica massacre of 1995 - when more than 8,000 men and boys were killed in a Bosnian town - could be repeated in the Old City of Homs.

In 2008, another George Formby banjo ukulele sold for for £72,000 at auction to Queen's Brian May.
In 1936, the BBC banned Formby's song The Window Cleaner for being smutty.
John Croft, former president of the George Formby Society and ukulele expert, said: ""There is huge interest in this instrument. George Formby has fans all over the world - young and old.""
Mr Croft, from Llanyblodwel, Shropshire, added it was a ""wonderful piece of social history"".
""In his heyday in the late 1930s, George Formby earned more than three top Hollywood stars put together - Errol Flynn, Douglas Fairbanks and Clark Gable.
""And we should never forget Formby's contribution to boosting morale among the troops during World War Two.
""He and his wife Beryl flew out to dangerous war zones, including El Alamein. This country owes a great deal to them both.
""I hope the instrument stays in the UK but the most important thing is that it is loved and played.""
This banjolele was originally purchased by Bill Logan, the first president of the George Formby Society.
Who was George Formby?
He was born George Hoy Booth on 26 May 1904, in Wigan and was the eldest of seven children
The actor, singer-songwriter and comedian's show business career started in 1921 and lasted 40 years until his death in 1961
He was famous for playing the banjolele and by 1939 was the most popular and highest paid entertainer in the British Isles - he was estimated to be earning more than £100,000 a year
Formby appeared in 21 films, made more than 230 records, entertained on stage hundreds of times, performed twice by royal command and entertained an estimated three million allied servicemen and women during World War Two
In 1960, Formby made his last record, Happy Go Lucky Me, and in December that year made what was his final television programme, The Friday Show

35967010,"Hollywood actress Glenn Close stars in the musical, which opened on Monday evening at London's Coliseum theatre.
Writing in The Guardian, Michael Billington said the new production had given the show ""a new lease of life"".
""Close delivers the big lines not with a camp flourish but as if they were sincerely felt,"" he said.
Billington noted that the show had ""none of the epic scale of the original London production"" but added this was to the producers' credit: ""Sometimes semi-staged is better than the luxurious grandeur of an elephantine West End musical.""
Glenn Close is reprising the role of Norma Desmond, a character she first played in Los Angeles in 1993. She won a Tony award for her Broadway performance in 1995.
Holly Williams from theatre website WhatsOnStage said: ""It might be 20 years since she bagged a Tony in this part, but I wouldn't bet against her scooping a few shiny new gongs this time round.""
However, some critics did note that Close's voice occasionally struggled with the higher notes.
""[Close's] vocal instrument may not be as sharp as it once was, but she brings an utterly ferocious intensity to the part and the songs,"" Mark Shenton wrote in his review for The Stage.
Time Out also had some criticisms of the production: ""Like many later Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals, Sunset Boulevard is not brilliant.""
Andrzej Lukowski added that ""69-year-old Close is definitely a bit old to play 50-year-old silent movie star Norma Desmond"".
Rod McPhee, writing in The Daily Mirror, said Close ""masterfully belts out the show's biggest numbers, and earned rapturous applause as a result. Her first musical in London's West End proves that she's far from a fading star.""
Sunset Boulevard tells the story of a Hollywood writer named Joe (played in the new production by Michael Xavier), who is being chased by mob creditors.
Joe seeks refuge in a Los Angeles mansion, only to discover it is already being inhabited by Norma Desmond, a wealthy but forgotten silent movie star.
Culture minister Ed Vaizey attended Monday evening's performance, tweeting: ""Absolutely wonderful. Glenn Close gives the performance of a lifetime. One of the best things I have seen.""
Speaking to the BBC after she came off stage on Monday evening, Close said: ""Norma Desmond is one of the best parts ever written for a woman.""
""It's a phenomenal show, it's such an exciting journey and it has been the best adventure. I feel so lucky. I am on such an emotional high, I've never had this kind of response.""",A new production of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Sunset Boulevard has received a positive response from critics.
26463938,"Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif dismissed them as ""failed lies"".
He claimed they were published ""just in time"" for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference, which took place earlier this week.
On Wednesday, Israel's military said it had found the rockets on a ship it seized in the Red Sea off Sudan.
The Klos-C, a Panamanian-flagged vessel, is currently being escorted to the southern Israeli port of Eilat, and is expected to arrive on Saturday. Its 17-member crew were apparently unaware of their cargo.
The Klos-C was transporting dozens of M-302 rockets, which have a range of 150km to 200km (93-124 miles), Israeli military spokesman Brig-Gen Moti Almoz said.
""The ship may be carrying other weapons as well, but we can only know this when it reaches Eilat.""
""There is clear and unequivocal information that this came from Iran.""
On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had tracked the weapons for several months as they were flown from Damascus to Tehran and then taken to a port in southern Iran.
From there, it added, they were loaded on to the KLOS-C, which sailed to Iraq, where containers of cement were added. The ship was eventually intercepted while on its way to Sudan.
On Thursday, Mr Zarif rejected the allegations and questioned why they had surfaced just after the conference a pro-Israel US lobby group.
""An Iranian ship carrying arms for Gaza,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Captured just in time for annual AIPAC anti-Iran campaign. Amazing Coincidence! Or same failed lies.""
A spokesman for Hamas, the militant Palestinian Islamist movement that governs Gaza, said they were a ""silly joke"".
Israel has long accused Iran of arming groups such as Hamas.
More than 60 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip have hit Israel since the start of last year, Israel says.
Hamas denies that it has fired any rockets since a 2012 ceasefire agreement with Israel, with other Gaza-based groups claiming responsibility. However, Israel says it hold Hamas responsible for any attacks from Gaza and has repeatedly launched deadly air strikes.
During a visit to California on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the discovery of the shipment had revealed ""the true face of Iran"" to world powers attempting to negotiate a comprehensive agreement on its controversial nuclear programme.
""Iran has been exposed for what it is,"" he told reporters. ""It smiles in the Geneva talks about its own nuclear ambitions, gives soothing words, and as they're doing that, they're shipping these deadly weapons to the world's worst terrorists.""
In a speech at the AIPAC conference on Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu had reiterated his unhappiness with the prospect of a long-term deal that would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium and engaging in other activities that might allow it to develop nuclear weapons.
At a news conference in Jakarta on Thursday, Mr Zarif insisted that Iran's nuclear programme was solely for peaceful purposes.
""I do not believe dismantling of this programme is helpful to the cause of non-proliferation because Iran has technology, Iran has the scientists, Iran has the capability,"" he said.
""So the best way to ensure that these scientists, and the technology, and the capability, and the workshop are designed only for peaceful purposes and used exclusively for peaceful purposes is to have them out in the open under international monitoring,"" Iran's foreign minister added.",Iran has rejected Israeli allegations that it was behind a shipment of Syrian-made rockets intended for Palestinian militants in Gaza.
40447105,"Zaur Dadayev shot the former deputy prime minister, a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin, in February 2015 near the Kremlin.
Four others acted as accomplices. The group were allegedly promised $250,000 (Â£192,000) to kill Nemtsov. They all denied the charges.
Nemtsov's relatives fear that whoever ordered the murder will never be found.
Russian authorities are still looking for another Chechen said to be behind the killing, Ruslan Mukhudinov. He believed to have fled abroad.
But lawyers for Nemtsov's family have said the investigators have exaggerated Mr Mukhudinov's role and ""the masterminds are high-ranking people"".
The jury in Moscow convicted the five men after more than eight months of hearings.
Zaur Dadayev is former member of an elite military unit. He was under the command of pro-Moscow's Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia's Chechen Republic in the North Caucasus.
The other four defendants are brothers Anzor Gubashev and Shadid Gubashev, Khamzat Bakhayev and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov.
A sixth man, Beslan Shabanov, died while he was being detained in Chechnya.
Nemtsov served as first deputy prime minister under President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, and later became a vocal critic of President Putin.
The 55-year-old was shot dead on 27 February 2015 on his way from a restaurant in central Moscow. Earlier that day he was interviewed on a liberal radio station, in which he had called on listeners to join a rally.
At the time, Nemtsov was working on a report examining Russia's alleged role in the conflict in Ukraine.
President Putin called the murder ""vile and cynical"" and vowed to hold those responsible to account.
Russia has seen several killings of high-profile politicians and journalists in recent years.
But the country has a long history of prosecuting alleged hit-men and failing to follow the chain of command to discover who ordered the murder, correspondents say.
It took the 12 jury members more than 12 hours to reach their verdict. They spent it in a closed room in one corner of the military courthouse with a guard posted outside the window.
But when they finally filed back into court, it was to pronounce every one of the accused guilty. In each case they ruled by a clear majority.
Standing opposite them inside a glass cage, surrounded by armed police and a Rottweiler, the men from Chechnya listened in silence, looking relaxed and even smiling as they had for much of this trial.
There was speculation that one of the accused, Khamzat Bakhayev, might be acquitted for lack of evidence. When the jury found him guilty too, his wife burst into tears.
But outside, lawyers representing Boris Nemtsov's family said they believe the trail of evidence leads to senior figures within Chechnya, loyal to Vladimir Putin. They've vowed to go on pushing until they uncover who actually ordered Boris Nemtsov killed, and why.",A Russian jury has found five ethnic Chechen men guilty of murdering leading opposition politician Boris Nemtsov.

A not guilty plea was entered on Mr Terry's behalf at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
He will now stand trial on 9 July, nine days after Euro 2012.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Mr Terry, 31, is accused of a racially-aggravated public order offence.
Following Wednesday's hearing, the footballer's legal team said in a statement: ""Mr Terry looks forward to the opportunity to clear his name.
By Dan RoanBBC Sports News Correspondent
The fact that Terry will not stand trial until July means he is now free to lead England into the European Championship, the Football Association, along with Chelsea, having made clear it will not suspend him.
However, it also means these serious charges will hang over him for a further five months.
Terry says he does not wish to talk about the case, but you can be sure he will be asked.
Some will worry about the effect this uncertainty will have over on his performances in the summer and the England team's morale.
""Mr Terry denies making any racist statement and will establish in court that he is not guilty of any such offence.
""Mr Terry has never racially abused another player in his entire career.''
Police questioned Mr Terry under caution in November and a file on the matter was sent to the CPS at the beginning of December.
The decision to charge Mr Terry was taken after police received a complaint from a member of the public after the Premier League match at Loftus Road.
The maximum sentence for the offence is a fine of £2,500.
As a summary offence under the Crime and Disorder Act, it will be fully heard in a magistrates' court.","England football captain John Terry will stand trial for alleged racist abuse in July, after the final of the European Championship in July."

Tensions between the countries are high with the Gulf a potential flashpoint.
US Naval Forces Central Command spokesman Commander Bill Urban said the incident happened in international air space as an F/A-18E Super Hornet was preparing to land on the USS Nimitz.
Despite radio warnings to stay clear of the carrier, the drone carried out ""unsafe and unprofessional"" altitude changes near the jet, he said.
""The dangerous manoeuvre by the QOM-1 [drone] in the known vicinity of fixed-wing flight operations and at coincident altitude with operating aircraft created a collision hazard and is not in keeping with international maritime customs and laws,"" Cdr Urban said.
The incident is the latest in a series of close encounters in the Gulf between US and Iranian forces.
In July, a US Navy ship fired warning shots at an Iranian Revolutionary Guard vessel after it came within 140m (450ft) and ignored radio calls.
In January, a US destroyer fired three warning shots when Iranian fast-attack vessels approached at high speed in the Strait of Hormuz.","An Iranian drone has flown dangerously close to a US fighter jet as it was about to land on a carrier in the Gulf, the US Navy says."

""I have told my officials to report to me on an urgent basis. There is no need to panic. Very soon we will come out with the [inquiry] report,"" he said.
Delhi-based environmental think-tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said in its report that it had collected 38 bread and bakery samples from retail stores, bakeries and fast-food shops in Delhi for its study.

The bread manufacturers' association said it was yet to see the CSE report, but added that the two additives were safe and ""widely used in advanced countries like the US"".

39181972,"A BBC investigation reveals Southampton docks does not monitor its air pollution rates, despite the city being among the most polluted in the UK.
Southampton City Council estimates the port contributes up to 23 per cent of air pollution in the city.
Ships can use a ""plug-in"" system to reduce emissions but not in the UK.
It comes after the World Health Organisation (WHO) called Southampton one of the most polluted cities in the UK.
The city's port welcomes thousands of ships a year, including some of the biggest cruise liners and container ships in the world.
The vessels leave their engines running while docked to power their electrics, but elsewhere in the world ships use a shore-based electricity supply, virtually eliminating their emissions.
Cargo and cruise ships, including the Queen Mary 2 and Britannia which regularly dock in Southampton, use the method - just not when visiting the British port.
Port Director Alastair Welch from ABP said: ""The challenge has been in particular there is no one standard for shore power. I'd like it in place as soon as possible.
""I should emphasise shore power is not the only answer and that's why we're working with solar power and hybrid ships now, because all of them have a part to play for the future.""
A review of Air Quality in Southampton in 2015 by the local authority showed the port is believed to contribute between seven and 23 per cent of the air pollution, while cars contribute 18 per cent and HGVs 12 per cent.
The government has since told Southampton to implement clean air zones by 2020 and the council is implementing a Clean Air Strategy to meet national goals.","Southampton, the biggest cruise port in Britain, has no way of monitoring air pollution generated by emissions from the largest ships in the world."

Introducing Mrs Obama, the former first lady said her voice was needed in this election ""more than ever"".
Mrs Clinton referred to Mr Trump's ongoing feud with the Khans and accused him of ""rubbing salt into the wounds of a grieving family"".
Mr Khan's son Humayun was killed by a car bomb in 2004 in Iraq at the age of 27.
Their grief became part of the presidential campaign in July when Khizr Khan made an emotional speech at the Democratic Convention attacking Mr Trump for anti-Muslim rhetoric, as his wife stood next to him.
The Republican candidate's reaction, in which he implied the mother was not allowed to speak up, attracted strong condemnation from within his own party.
Speaking to ABC News in an interview aired on Thursday, Mr Trump repeated his insistence that their son would be alive, but added he believed the soldier was a ""great hero"".
In response, Mr Khan said: ""This is the most cruel thing you can say to grieving parents, that if I was there this would not have happened.""

28129490,"The taskforce was appointed by the Social Development Minister Nelson McCausland.
It was asked to examine the impact of negative equity and repossessions.
The taskforce has warned that the number of people falling behind on their mortgage payments could increase as interest rates begin to rise.
The taskforce is now undertaking further work aimed at developing policy recommendations.
Northern Ireland suffered a huge housing bubble followed by a crash that saw prices fall by almost 50%.
As a consequence, rates of negative equity are much worse than elsewhere in the UK and repossessions have also increased.
A major ""at risk"" group identified by the taskforce are households who undertook ""equity release"" remortgages at the height of the market.
They are people who increased their mortgages to release cash for other purposes, such as home improvements or to finance buy-to-let properties.
In 2007, 74% of remortgaging in Northern Ireland was for equity release.
The taskforce said this category of ""credit hungry"" borrower was disproportionately active in Northern Ireland.
Lower income groups who took out ""second charge"" mortgages with subprime lenders are also at high-risk.
The taskforce said those lenders have shown ""a more tenacious approach to arrears management"".
However, it said, in general, lenders have shown ""forbearance"" and if they had not done so rates of repossessions would be higher.
The taskforce warned that, despite a gradual recovery in the Northern Ireland economy and the housing market, major risks remain.
It said that the Northern Ireland economy ""remains some distance from reaching escape velocity""' and that borrowers are ""poorly equipped to absorb future income shocks"".","The Northern Ireland housing market remains ""dysfunctional"" and poses a risk to economic recovery, a Stormont-backed taskforce has concluded."
17906348,"Borge helped to create the Sandinista National Liberation Front in 1961.
In 1979, the Sandinista revolution overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza and Borge served as interior minister in the new government of Daniel Ortega.
US President Ronald Reagan saw the revolutionaries as a threat and backed the right-wing Contras in the civil war that followed.
An estimated 30,000 people died in the fighting which lasted a decade and wrecked the country's economy.
Borge was born into a poor family and dedicated himself to the struggle against the Somoza family, which had run Nicaragua for 40 years.
He received military training in Cuba before he helped to found the Sandinista movement.
The organisation was named after Augusto Cesar Sandino, who fought against US intervention in Nicaragua in the 1930s.
Borge became the powerful interior minister in the Ortega government of the 1980s, where he imposed censorship on the media and was accused of human rights violations.
However, he denied accusations that he was responsible for expelling and harassing clergymen during the war.
The Sandinistas were voted out of power in 1990.
Congressman Jacinto Suarez was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying Borge was ""a transcendental figure in Nicaraguan history"".
But the news agency also quoted Nicaraguan writer Gioconda Belli, who said of Borge's later life: ""After 1990, I have the sense he gave up his revolutionary ideas... He ended up a tragic-comic figure"".

During his first news conference at Old Trafford, Van Gaal insisted he was more ""democrat"" than autocrat, extolling his ""strong personality"" - a trait, he reminded his audience, he shares with former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.
But why does Van Gaal come to English football with such a fearsome reputation? BBC Sport gets the inside story on his biggest bust-ups.
The time he was told he was too slow
Louis van Gaal never lacked confidence and his strong personality was there, even as a player. He made his name as a midfielder with the Royal FC Antwerp, under Guy Thys, the legendary Belgian coach.
""I was annoyed that he did not always play me,"" Van Gaal later recalled. ""I was one of four foreigners and he could only play three in those days. Thys reckoned I lacked pace.''
Thys said: ""He'd come up to me and ask me why I did not play him. 'Boss, I am the best player, aren't I?' And then I would tell him he was not. He could not believe that.
""I do admit he had by far the strongest personality of all the players I have come across. But, sorry to say, he was slow… ""
One of Van Gaal's best performances came in a 4-1 victory over Aston Villa in the home leg of the Uefa Cup tie in 1975. ""That day against Villa he was absolutely brilliant,"" Thys remembered. ""For the return match he asked how he should play. I said: 'Like you normally do, slowly.'
""I remember that conversation well. He could not see the funny side of my answer.  But we needed to take the pace out of the game. And it worked. We beat them in Birmingham 1-0. And Louis was fantastic again. He never played such a brilliant game again.''
Van Gaal was infuriated by Thys's negative approach to the second leg. He felt Antwerp should have kept attacking. ""I had respect for him as a person, but I did not rate him as a coach,"" Van Gaal said. ""Probably because he put me on the bench too often. I reckoned I should play. He did not.''
Van Gaal was so unhappy in Belgium football he wanted to leave. ""I wrote 80 letters to get a job elsewhere. I only got one or two replies, but I did get my move,"" he said.
""Thys threatened to stop me from leaving by demanding a big transfer fee. So I said, do what you like, but I will take my old job of PE teacher again, if you do that. No sweat at all. So they let me go.''
The time Rivaldo wanted to change position
In 1999 Van Gaal was in charge of Barcelona and Rivaldo was at the peak of his powers.  The brilliant Brazilian inspired Van Gaal's side to their second consecutive La Liga title from out on the left wing, collecting the Fifa World Player of the Year award in the process.
Boudewijn Zenden, who was with Barca at the time, recently recalled what happened next: ""Rivaldo thought he was better off playing behind the strikers, so when he won the Golden Ball he just said to Van Gaal: 'I don't want to play on the left anymore. I want to play behind the strikers.' Van Gaal said: 'Right. that's your decision' and he sat on the bench - because only the manager decided where he would play.""
Although he quickly got back into the team, Rivaldo only scored 12 league goals that season - down from 24 the previous campaign - and Van Gaal left after Barca failed to retain the La Liga title.
His departure was celebrated by the media, who had disapproved of his stance with Rivaldo and also disliked Van Gaal for his aggressive attitude towards them and failure to fully learn either Spanish or Catalan. Upon his departure, Van Gaal famously announced to the media: ""Friends of the press, I am leaving. Congratulations.""
The (many) times he has clashed with Johan Cruyff
The Dutch nation can be divided in two halves in terms of their loyalties - pro-Cruyff and pro-Van Gaal.  The two men have never got on. They are opposites: Cruyff, the world-class player who naturally became a manager. Van Gaal, the ordinary player with an academic background who became a world-class manager.
The annoying thing for Cruyff was that Van Gaal followed him to the two biggest loves of his life, Ajax and Barcelona, and was successful at both.
In his autobiography, Van Gaal alleges the feud began in 1989 when he hurriedly left a dinner at Cruyff's house without thanking his host for the meal after receiving a phone call informing him of the death of his sister - a claim rejected by Cruyff.
A decade later, Van Gaal felt that Cruyff undermined his managerial stint at the Nou Camp by repeated criticisms in the Catalan press, with Van Gaal bitterly noting: ""I will never forgive what he did.""
Their enmity simmered for years, not helped by Cruyff's observations that Van Gaal has ""one or two screws loose in his head"", but it reached new depths in 2011, when Cruyff took the extraordinary step of going to court to prevent Ajax from appointing Van Gaal as their new chief executive.
Cruyff was one of five members of Ajax's advisory panel and the only one who didn't want Van Gaal - so the other four went behind his back to appoint him anyway. Cruyff was furious, took the legal route and was eventually successful as the court ruled in his favour, overturning the appointment. Van Gaal said: ""Of course it hurt. People forget that Ajax is also part of my life.''
The time he showed Mark van Bommel the door
When Van Gaal arrived at Bayern Munich in the summer of 2009, Mark van Bommel - his captain and compatriot - was one of the most important players as the club won the domestic double in Van Gaal's first season.
But in the winter break of the following season, Bayern bought Hoffenheim's 23-year-old Brazilian Luiz Gustavo for £13m. Gustavo was one of the rising Bundesliga midfielders... and 10 years van Bommel's junior.
Van Gaal told van Bommel in person he was no longer his captain, adding that his future competitors would also be Andreas Ottl, Anatoliy Timoschtschuk and Danijel Pranjic. Van Bommel was furious and Bayern watchers mystified. Nobody played the role of central defensive midfielder better than Van Bommel and the comparisons seemed insulting.
But Van Gaal wanted to make his team younger and to strengthen his position in the club by getting rid of one of their most important players. It was also said he feared that Van Bommel, who was good friends with Arjen Robben and Bastian Schweinsteiger, was becoming too powerful.
The German press saw it as an egocentric way of making it clear who was in charge, but Van Gaal was unrepentant, saying: ""It is normal that the relationship crashes when a manager does not pick a certain player any more. A manager has the right to do it. Mark was very angry with me. But I did not decide whether he should leave or not.""
By the end of that month Van Bommel had joined AC Milan.
When Luca Toni got an ear-bashing at the dinner table
The Italian international Luca Toni was a big hero at Bayern when Van Gaal arrived, having won the double playing alongside Franck Ribery under Ottmar Hitzfeld in his first season and scored 38 goals in 56 Bundesliga games across two campaigns. But from their first days together, Toni and Van Gaal had a terrible relationship.
In one training camp the Dutch coach was unhappy with Toni's manners when the team assembled for meetings and meals. One day Toni, a tall man, was slouching on his chair during dinner, as if he were watching TV on a sofa. Van Gaal went behind Toni's chair and pulled his ears to make him sit up straight.
For a proud Italian this was a humiliation. ""The way Van Gaal treated the key players was unworthy on a human basis,"" Toni later reflected.
In September 2009, Van Gaal forced Toni to play two matches for FC Bayern II, their amateur team in Germany's third division, while he was recovering from an Achilles tendon injury. The match was watched by about 2,000 fans as the 2006 World Cup winner stumbled on the bumpy ground at the old stadium.
Van Gaal, though something of a showman himself, could not stand Toni's playboy image, with the Italian frequently portrayed as Bayern's ""beau"". The coach also felt Toni lacked discipline and fined the Italian in November 2009 when he left the stadium at half-time, having been substituted during a match against Schalke.
The time he dropped his pants
Van Gaal revelled in his reputation as fearlessly belligerent and at Bayern went to extreme lengths to prove it. ""Van Gaal wanted to make clear to us that he can drop any player from the team,"" Luca Toni revealed later.
""It was all the same to him because, as he said, he had the balls. He demonstrated this literally by dropping his pants. I have never experienced anything like it, it was totally crazy. Luckily I didn't see a lot, because I wasn't in the front row.""
The time he insulted his Bayern bosses
In October 2010 Van Gaal invited Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeness, two senior members of the Bayern hierarchy, to the launch of his new book, Biographie & Vision, in a Munich hotel.
It should have been a convivial moment, especially as Hoeness had written the book's foreword. However, Bayern were experiencing their worst ever start to the season at the time and were 13 points from the top of the league, which made it all the stranger when the ever-confident Van Gaal gave them a copy, saying: ""You can learn from it. It is important that you read it.""
His bosses looked on angrily but not did say anything. Realising what had happened, he said afterwards: ""Maybe I will get fined for it, but I don't think so."" He did not get fined but many date the rift between him and the club to this moment and he was sacked six months later.

The time the 'ultimate professional' won him round
Not all of Van Gaal's clashes have a bitter end. When he took over as Dutch coach for the second time after the team's disastrous performances at Euro 2012, the atmosphere among the Dutch players was so bad that the first thing Van Gaal did after his appointment was to bring them together in a luxurious hotel room in the village of Noordwijk on the Dutch coast, close to where he lives in a big penthouse.
He asked for their views on the 2012 Euro finals. Most gave theirs but Van Persie remained silent because, Van Gaal later discovered, he did not want to criticise anyone by speaking out.
""I saw that as a negative attitude,"" Van Gaal said, ""so I declared that from that day on Klaas-Jan Huntelaar would be my number one striker and Robin had to accept a role on the bench.''
The first game of Van Gaal's second stint as coach was against Belgium, ironically the night Van Persie's transfer to Manchester United was confirmed. He stayed on the bench for the whole 90 minutes, but did not complain.
When asked if he regretted Van Gaal's appointment, the forward said: ""Not at all. From what I have seen in the first few days, he has all the qualities of a fabulous manager. I say that despite the fact he has put me on the bench.''

Van Gaal, who had expected Van Persie to react negatively,  was amazed by the ""professional attitude and spirit"" of his striker. ""I had to admit later that I really did not know the person behind the player, Van Persie in 2012. I knew certain players shared my football philosophy. About Robin I knew nothing.
""I had to get to know him. But when I did, I soon realised he was an amazing professional. He was the ultimate pro. And also important for me was that he was very social towards the other players in the squad.
""He showed leadership - and this is why 10 months later I made him captain of the Dutch team. He deserved that. He completely shares my vision on football.''
Additional reporting from Andy West, Patrick Strasser and Marcel van der Kraan.",New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has never been afraid to have an argument or make it clear who is in charge.
38944626,"Tess Newall, who had worn her great-great grandmother's dress at her wedding in June, posted a plea on Facebook to help find it, which was shared more than 300,000 times.
Luckily her dress was found but what is the appeal for brides of choosing a dress once worn by a relative? Three women explained why they had ditched trawling the bridal shops for the perfect dress in favour of a borrowed gown.
Kate Ridgway, from Stockport, made the decision to wear her grandmother's wedding dress in 2014.
""I remember it from when I was a child,"" said the 27-year-old. ""I always knew nan had kept it and I tried it on for dressing up, but back then I thought it was a horrid lacy thing.""
However, when she got engaged to her now-husband Stu, Joan Chatfield, known as ""Nanny Chat"", asked if she would like to wear it on her big day.
""I was heavily pregnant at the time, so I couldn't try it on,"" said Kate. ""But she had always wanted me to wear it.""
Then, three days after Kate's eldest son was born, her nan passed away.
When she travelled down to Sussex for the funeral, her mother handed her the box with the vintage wedding dress from 1951, and everything fell into place.
""When I tried it on, it fitted perfectly,"" she said. ""I had it cleaned but I didn't have to do anything else to it.
""I had tried on brand new wedding dresses and I had fallen in love with one, but this felt different and so special.
""It meant so much to us as a family for me to wear it and, as you can imagine, it made for a very emotional day.""
London-based digital designer Emily Clark also hopes to start a tradition of her own by using her mother's frock for her wedding this October.
The 33-year-old said her mother's dress, which was first worn in 1980, had played a big part in her childhood.
""I used to dress in my mum's wedding dress from the age of five or six to - if I'm truthful - until I was 15.
""It's one of a kind, it's a dress you wouldn't be able to find now and you wouldn't be able to replicate.""
The dress was bought by her grandfather, who died last year. She said the dress would act as a way of commemorating him at her wedding to fiance Andrew Stewart.
The dress is currently being altered, and when she heard that Mrs Newall's had gone missing at the dry cleaners she says she ""did panic"".
She added: ""I just think it's wonderful that they've had it returned.""
For Rachel Cohen, from Edinburgh, the discovery of her grandmother's dress in the loft spurred on the idea to go retro.
""I knew there were dresses up there amongst a lot of random stuff,"" she said.
""I even found one dress which much have been from a previous generation, but it just couldn't have been worn.""
However, the one Granny Marie Waterston wore in the 1930s was in superb condition and perfect for Rachel's special day.
""I had never been the type of person to dream of a big white dress, so when I found it, packed away all neat and tidy in a box, I had the idea to wear it,"" she said.
""I had to cut the sleeves off as she had such tiny hands, but otherwise it was the same.""
Having her grandmother's dress meant a lot to Rachel when she married in 2009.
""My mother died when I was young and I looked after my grandmother when she was old, so we had a close relationship,"" said Rachel.
""It was special to have her dress there, even when she couldn't be.""
While those three brides opted for the personal touch with their dresses, they join growing numbers of people choosing vintage items more generally.
Louise Croft, ethical fashion blogger at PaupertoPrincess.com - who will be wearing a 1940s gown for her wedding later this year - said going vintage had many benefits, from following fashion cycles to stopping garments ending up in landfills.
She said the growth of online sharing had also led to brides wanting to stand out even more, and going down the classic route often means the dress is one of a kind.
""It feels like giving a precious piece of history a moment in the limelight rather than it being in a museum or attic,"" added Louise.
""Of course, you always wonder what tales and secrets it holds and if it's from a family member then you are lucky enough to also have all these answers.""
Kat Williams, editor of Rock 'n Roll Bride, said although dresses have been passed down for many years, a lot more people were putting their own touches to them.
""We had one woman in the magazine who wore her grandmother's dress and customised it all to make it more modern,"" she said. ""She shortened it, added a big petticoat and made it more fitted.
""It looked great but offered that little bit of family history too.
""Even if you buy a dress from a vintage shop, it means you won't see lots of other brides wearing the same thing and a bride wants to feel unique.""",Social media was captivated by a 150-year-old wedding dress that had been lost after a dry cleaners went bust.
32818373,"Myles Bradbury has lodged an appeal against a 22-year jail sentence imposed last December.
He admitted abusing 18 children at Addenbrooke's in Cambridge between 2009 and 2013.
The mother of the 11-year-old abused when he was kept on as a patient told the BBC Bradbury should never be freed.
Bradbury, 41, from Herringswell in Suffolk, was jailed at Cambridge Crown Court for sexual assault, voyeurism and possessing more than 16,000 indecent images.
The court heard the images of his victims were taken in the hospital.
Victims told investigators Bradbury had focused on examining their private parts when there was no medical need to do so.
The child, who is now 13, was referred to Bradbury because his older sister had a blood disorder and it was feared he might have the same condition.
But, his mother said, there was nothing wrong with him.
Instead of discharging him from his patient list, Bradbury continued seeing and abusing the boy for a year.
The boy is currently on heavy medication to deal with the mental effects of his abuse.
His mother said she did not know how Bradbury could appeal.
She said: ""He is in prison now, probably doing his crafts or whatever. We are suffering every day.
""He does not understand the knock-on effect he has had on families.""

Nine in ten of those asked felt that they were prepared to wait on the line for no longer than five minutes.
Richard Headland, editor of Which? magazine, said: ""Waiting on hold is a waste of time, but some organisations make the experience needlessly annoying through objectionable messages and music.

Jo Causon, chief executive of the Institute of Customer Service, a trade body, said: ""People are time-poor and less likely to be happy waiting for service as a result. It means consumers are less understanding of organisations that do not make it easy to get in touch.
""If businesses want to enjoy ongoing customer loyalty - and attract new business - their focus should be on convenience and efficiency. In short, this means getting it right quickly, and getting it right first time. Anything less, and customers will think twice about spending money or recommending them to others.""

Once Scotland's undisputed number seven, he has suffered an awful run of bad luck culminating with the loss of his Test place to Hamish Watson.
""I've been unfortunate, but I'm looking to put it behind me and finish the season on a real high,"" said Hardie.
The New Zealand-born back-row, 28, was one of Scotland's stars at the 2015 World Cup, his work-rate and impact at the breakdown catching the eye. He was talked about as one of the players of the tournament, but this season has brought one setback after another.
In November, during a bruising Test against Australia, Hardie suffered damage to his ankle and knee, while also suffering a concussion. It took him two months to recover.
Following on from that, he was selected to play against Wales in the Six Nations but had to retire after just 24 minutes. Then he appeared as a substitute in the game against France but only lasted five minutes before having to go off injured again.
Townsend named Hardie in the starting line-up for his first Test as Scotland coach, against Italy in Singapore, but Hardie suffered a back spasm in the warm-up and had to withdraw.
""Everybody gets injuries and everybody has low patches, but rehab is a really good time to look at it as a positive, even though it isn't so much,"" Hardie told BBC Scotland.
""You have to get your body right and get other aspects of your rugby game right. I've had a lot of time to do that.

The reported sales surge comes amid an ongoing boycott targeting business interests of the fashion entrepreneur's father, President Donald Trump.
Last month several retailers dropped Ms Trump's label, citing falling sales.
In an interview with fashion magazine Refinery29, Ms Klem declined to cite specific sales figures, but research by a market analytics firm seems to support the claim.
According to Lyst, a London-based e-commerce website which tracks clothing retail, sales of Ivanka Trump products rocketed in February.
It says sales increased 346% from January to February this year and 557%, compared with average orders last year.
""To see such an extreme spike in one month is completely unheard of and came as a huge surprise to us,"" says Lyst's US spokesperson Sarah Tanner.
Ms Klem said that most products are sold to women in New York, California and Texas, and the average shopper earns between $60,000-100,000 per year (Â£50,000-Â£82,000).
She said the political controversy surrounding President Trump, and the boycott, may have helped his daughter's brand.
The reported sales surge comes after Kellyanne Conway, a counsellor to President Trump, was accused of breaking ethics rules by promoting Ivanka Trump products during a live TV interview from the White House.
The first daughter's perfume is currently highest ranked on Amazon.com, with many shoppers leaving pro-Trump comments.
""I bought this without knowing what it smelt like, and I didn't care! I support the Trumps! MAGA! Who needs nordstroms!"" Dustin M wrote, in reference to Nordstroms, which was the first retailer to drop Ivanka's products.

Mr Bell said work on changing the legislation would begin ""at the end of this year, early next year"".
The Termination of Pregnancy Act 1995 is the current law governing abortions in the Isle of Man.
This means a termination can only be carried out on the island in the case of a pregnancy arising from a criminal offence such as rape, or on mental health grounds.
For most women seeking an abortion, the only option is to travel to the UK to pay for the procedure.
Manx campaign group, CALM (Campaign for Abortion Law Modernisation), which was established in April, wants island legislation to be brought in line with the UK.
Although it is not currently illegal, the group said it is ""almost impossible"" for women to have a termination on the Isle of Man.
A spokesman added: ""The current act is incredibly restrictive. We are not saying abortion should be available to everyone at the drop of a hat.""
Anti-abortion campaigners at the rally held banners saying: ""Thou shalt not kill"".

33536930,"Steve Huffman said that he had not created the news comment platform ""to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen"".
He promised to provide further details on Thursday.
One expert said the plan would probably enrage many of the site's users.
Last week, Reddit's previous chief executive, Ellen Pao, resigned after an online petition calling for her dismissal attracted more than 213,000 signatures.
The petition had accused Ms Pao of leading the site into a ""new age of censorship"" after five ""subreddit communities"" run by volunteers had been banned for failing to tackle the ""harassment of individuals"".
However, one of Reddit's other former chief executives - who no longer works for the company - has since suggested that Ms Pao was less minded to restrict users' activities than many of her critics had assumed.
""On at least two separate occasions, the board pressed [Ms Pao] to outright ban all the hate subreddits in a sweeping purge. She resisted,"" wrote Yishan Wong.
""She probably would have tolerated your existence so long as you didn't cause any problems. I know that her long-term strategies were to find ways to surface and publicise Reddit's good parts - allowing the bad parts to exist but keeping them out of the spotlight.""
Reddit attracted more than 163 million visitors last month, according to its own figures, making it one of the net's most popular destinations.
Mr Huffman co-founded Reddit in 2005 and was announced as the site's new chief last week, following Ms Pao's resignation.
In a message posted to the site on Tuesday, he said his top priority was to develop a ""comprehensive content policy"" and tools to enforce it.
""The overwhelming majority of content on Reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes Reddit great,"" he wrote.
""There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don't have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.
""We as a community need to decide together what our values are. To that end, I'll be hosting an AMA [Ask Me Anything session] on Thursday.""
More than 14,000 comments have been posted below the announcement by the site's users. Some support his action, others suggest it will destroy the community.
Several members said they now intended to switch to Voat - a rival site that promises to ""not meddle and not censor content"" unless it is illegal.
One analyst said it was inevitable that Mr Huffman's plans would antagonise many of Reddit's users, but added that was not necessarily a bad thing.

34113798,"Loch Glascarnoch near Garve supplies water to Mossford power station.
A road that used to link Inverness and Ullapool, two bridges and part of a telegraph pole have been visible and were photographed by Calum Maclean.
Glascarnoch and its dam form part of energy giant SSE's Conon hydro electric scheme, which involves six dams and seven power stations.
The dams and power plants were built in stages between the 1940s and 1960s.
A new road to Ullapool was built to replace the one lost under Loch Glascarnoch.
SSE said the water level of the loch had been lowered for operational reasons.

21913356,"A police investigation has been launched into the death of the 67-year-old - a wanted man in Russia, and an opponent of President Vladimir Putin.
A former Kremlin power-broker whose fortunes declined under Mr Putin, Mr Berezovsky emigrated to the UK in 2000.
Thames Valley Police said the death, at a property in Ascot, Berkshire, was being treated as unexplained.
The area around the property has been cordoned off to allow the investigation to take place, the force said.
The inquiry was at a very early stage and more details will be released when available, it added.
A South Central Ambulance Service spokeswoman said it had been called to the property at 15:18 GMT.
""We sent a number of ambulance officers and an ambulance to the address. The 67-year-old male was confirmed deceased at the scene,"" she said.
Last year, Mr Berezovsky lost a Â£3bn ($4.7bn) damages claim against Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich.
Mr Berezovsky claimed he had been intimidated by Mr Abramovich into selling shares in Russian oil giant Sibneft for a ""fraction of their true worth"".
The allegations were completely rejected by the London Commercial Court judge, who called Mr Berezovsky an ""inherently unreliable"" witness.

Russians have little sympathy for oligarchs, whether alive or dead.
That's because while Boris Berezovsky - and the tiny number of other tycoons - were striking rich in the 1990s, millions of people here were sliding into poverty.
As he gained in power, many Russians saw Berezovsky as the ""grey cardinal"" in the Kremlin - exerting huge political influence for his own benefit.
Having fled to London, he became a vocal Kremlin critic and pledged to work from self-imposed exile to depose President Putin. But back home in Russia,  many of Mr Putin's opponents blamed Berezovsky for having engineered the transfer of power from Yeltsin to Putin.
Boris Berezovsky will be remembered as a towering figure of the 1990s and as one of the most powerful men in Yeltsin's Russia.
BBC world affairs reporter Richard Galpin said sources have told him that Mr Berezovsky was depressed after the loss of the court case and was under financial pressure.
The tycoon's wealth is thought to have considerably diminished in recent years, leaving him struggling to pay debts in the wake of costly court cases.
Mr Berezovsky had made his fortune in the 1990s selling imported Mercedes as well as Russian-made cars.
He was one of the first Russian oligarchs - a tiny group of tycoons who at the end of communism used their connections to become rich almost overnight.
Later owning Sibneft, the national airline Aeroflot, and as primary shareholder in Russia's main television channel, he supported Boris Yeltsin's rise to power, enjoying huge influence during this era.
Mr Berezovsky survived numerous assassination attempts, including a bomb that decapitated his chauffeur.
During the later years of Yeltsin's presidency, Mr Berezovsky was part of the leader's inner circle as deputy secretary of Russia's security council.
""Boris Berezovsky was one of the most powerful men in Russia back in the 1990s,"" said the BBC's Moscow correspondent, Steve Rosenberg.
""He rose from being a mathematician, a computer programmer and a used car salesman, to being such an influential figure in Boris Yeltsin's Russia.""
He then played a role in Mr Putin's rise in the late-1990s, before the new president moved to curb the political ambitions of Russia's oligarchs.
Leaving Russia for self-imposed exile in the UK, Mr Berezovsky became one of Mr Putin's fiercest critics.
But our correspondent said that on Saturday, a spokesman for Mr Putin said that Mr Berezovsky had sought the president's permission to return to Russia.",Exiled Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky has been found dead at his home outside London.

35970160,"Bristol Crown Court heard that Vielstone and Gatooma homes in Devon had a room where residents were left alone, often without food and water.
Paul Hewitt, 70, denies charges of conspiracy to detain and falsely imprison residents.
Mr Hewitt also said he was unaware that residents missed meals and he would have ""made sure"" they were fed.
The court heard that a woman resident said she had been tied up in the room at Gatooma in Holsworthy
Mr Hewitt, from Teignmouth, said he would not approve of this, telling the court: ""Absolutely not. Mechanical restraint was a no no.""
He also denied stopping residents making home visits as a punishment.
Mr Hewitt said he purchased Gatooma in 2004 for residents with behavioural issues.
""It was about giving them a better quality of life,"" he said.
""They had been in hospital or locked units. We wanted them to be free to be part of a community set up and be free to go to the shops or the pub.""
Mr Hewitt, founder of Atlas Project Team Ltd, ran the two care homes for adults with learning disabilities.
He sold the business in 2006 but continued to be in charge, the court heard.
Mr Hewitt and employees Lee Farrant, 30, James Lawson, 41, Julie Barlow, 51, and Aaron Jones, 33, all from Devon, deny a series of charges against seven residents at Vielstone near Bideford and Gatooma in Holsworthy between 2010 and 2011.

Mr Cameron said the UK ""remains staunch"" in its ""defence of Israel's right to exist and to defend itself"".
Pro-Palestinian campaigners have denounced Mr Netanyahu's visit.
There were angry confrontations outside Downing Street on Wednesday between protesters demanding Mr Netanyahu's arrest for what they say amount to war crimes in Gaza and pro-Israel activists.
Although a petition calling for the Israeli PM's arrest secured enough signatures to be considered for a debate in Parliament, the bid was rejected earlier this week because ""visiting heads of foreign governments... have immunity from legal process, and cannot be arrested or detained"", the UK government said in a statement.
Arriving in Downing Street, Mr Netanyahu said: ""The Middle East is disintegrating under the twin forces of militant Islam - militant Sunnis led by Isis [Islamic State] and militant Shiites led by Iran.
""I believe that we can co-operate in practical ways to roll back the tide of militant Islam both in the Middle East and in Africa.""
The Israeli premier also said he was ""ready to resume direct negotiations with the Palestinians with no conditions whatsoever to entering negotiations... immediately"".
Talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in April 2014.
Mr Cameron praised the ""close relationship between Britain and Israel"" and the ""growing economic and commercial ties"" between the countries.

34713488,"Known as ""The Bulldozer"", he won with 58% of the vote to the 40% of his main rival Edward Lowassa.
The victory margin was a surprise - many analysts had predicted a tighter race after four opposition parties united behind Mr Lowassa's candidature.
It boiled down to Mr Magufuli's popularity, which superseded that of the governing Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) that has dominated politics since independence from British rule in 1961.
So what are the five big challenges he faces once in office?
Change was the buzzword during the election campaign. Now people will expect him to engage in a major house-cleaning exercise by showing the door to corrupt government officials and old-school public servants.
This will pose a huge political risk, as they are well-entrenched in CCM. But Mr Magufuli, the former works minister, will have to tackle corruption head-on, as Tanzanians have had enough of it.
His first big test will come with the appointment of a cabinet.
Will it be made up of people untainted by corruption? If not, voters will be disappointed.
After all, he has built his political career on the promise that he is not scared of taking risks, and that he works hard and acts fast.
Although the official unemployment rate is at around 10%, people sometimes get the impression that the crisis bigger - a recent advert for 70 jobs in the public service posts attracted more than 10,000 applications. Interviews had to be held in a football stadium.
Almost half of Tanzania's 50 million-strong population is made up of young people, and they are worst-affected by unemployment.
They voted with great enthusiasm, believing their fortunes will change under Mr Magufuli.
He will be under most pressure from them to deliver on his promise to create jobs - and end poverty.
He has promised to revive industries which are in bad shape, like the cotton and fish processing sectors.
Mr Magufuli has promised children free education from kindergarten to secondary school.
While many Tanzanians welcome this, they feel it is not enough. They want a higher standard of education with improved curriculums so that Tanzania can have a better-skilled work force.
Mr Magufuli will be hard-pressed to meet their demands - almost all state schools are short of desks, books and teachers.
With last week's local elections in Zanzibar scrapped because of alleged rigging, Mr Magufuli will have to make sure that a re-run takes place, and that it is free and fair.
When Mr Kikwete came to power, he promised to keep a close eye on the semi-autonomous islands, which are popular with tourists.
But as he leaves the office, more than 60% of Zanzibaris want more autonomy for the archipelago - an indication of their dissatisfaction with the union.
If Mr Magufuli can bring about a lasting solution, he will go down in history as one of Tanzania's most successful presidents - but it is a big if.
Outgoing President Jakaya Kikwete promised a new constitution, but failed to deliver on it during his 10 years in office.
The opposition gained many votes with its promise to make sweeping changes to the constitution - including reducing presidential powers and guaranteeing the impartiality of state institutions, like the electoral commission.
Mr Magufuli ignored the issue during the election campaign. Can he afford to do that throughout his presidency? Unlikely.",Tanzania's President-elect John Magufuli will be inaugurated on Thursday following his landslide victory in fiercely contested elections.
30452837,"The midfielder, 32, twice won the league during a nine-year spell at Stamford Bridge, including one success under Jose Mourinho in 2006.
Essien thinks Mourinho could do it again with his side top of the table.
He told BBC Sport: ""There is still a long way to go but I'm sure they are in a good position and once Jose is ahead it is very difficult to overtake him.""
Essien, who now plays for AC Milan, sees similarities between the current Chelsea side and the one he played for when Mourinho signed him from Lyon during his first spell in charge in 2005.
In an interview with BBC Sport, the Ghana international - who also played under Mourinho during a loan spell at Real Madrid - assesses the qualities of his former boss and Chelsea's prospects.
He also discusses his work with the #UnitedAgainstEbola project, a campaign for Health Africa International launched to try and combat the threat of ebola and the potential impact of the disease on the up-coming Africa Cup of Nations.
Essien on Chelsea:
""It's not a big surprise they are doing so well. Whoever works under Jose will tell you that he is the sort of man who always gets the best out of his players.
""The way they are playing now reminds me of when I first came to Chelsea. We were very hard to beat and we won most of our games and they are doing it this year.
""They have a lot of young players who can step up. I think they are going to become like Chelsea of years ago. And they will win trophies for their club.""
Essien on Mourinho:
""He is very close to his players and he knows how to talk to them. Sometimes he might ignore you a little bit just to get you a little bit angry and then go out there and perform. So he has his little ways to keep his players going.
""He is not scared of anyone. Sometimes he is too honest, but you don't have to take it personally. You have to prove to him that when you are on the pitch you are better. And that's what he wants.""
Essien on United Against Ebola:
""There was a joke about me on the internet that I have got ebola. I said this in not a joke and I came up with this campaign to try and educate people in Africa about the disease.
""I was not worried. I had not travelled to Africa. I was fine. I was in good health. People around the world were more worried about me so I tried to calm everybody down.
""I'm still working on it to try and get some of my team-mates and people I know to get involved and to promote this campaign and try to raise awareness and to raise money for those who need it.
""The most important thing is when someone has the virus how to deal with the person and how to go close to the person.
Essien on the impact of ebola on the Africa Cup of Nations:
""They have had to change the venue. So if we can all join together to solve this problem I think it will be very good for Africa.
""Some of the players will be a bit concerned. They will be a bit worried. But I think everything will be fine and I hope the Nations Cup will go on and we will have a fantastic tournament. We are crossing our fingers that the whole thing will go on and nothing will happen.
""They should feel safe in going and representing their countries. Hopefully the tournament will go on and we won't get any bad news.""

35101945,"The officer told French media how he and a colleague came face-to-face with one of three gunmen launching an attack, and shot him dead.
Ninety concert-goers were killed at the Bataclan concert hall, where Eagles of Death Metal were playing.
Dozens more people died in co-ordinated attacks across Paris on 13 November.
The policeman, a department head at the Paris anti-crime brigade (BAC), told FranceInfo radio (in French) that he and his colleague had been responding to reports of an explosion at the Stade de France when they were redirected.
They were ordered to go to the 10th and 11th arrondissements of Paris following news of shootings. On the way, they found panicked concert-goers fleeing the Bataclan and quickly decided to go inside.
""What surprised us immediately was the extremely bright light that blinded us,"" said the officer, whose identity has been protected for security reasons.
""The bewildering silence... and then hundreds of bodies one on top of the other.""
What happened at the Bataclan?
Who were the victims?
Soon after entering the music venue, the police duo saw a gunman walk on stage and point a Kalashnikov at an audience member.
""He was very calm,"" the officer said.
""Given the carnage, there was no doubt about what we had to do. We opened fire straight away. We kept shooting until he fell to the floor.""
The gunman was later identified as Foued Mohamed-Aggad, a 23-year-old French national from Strasbourg.
The two officers, who reportedly only had service weapons and light bulletproof vests, then heard an explosion from elsewhere in the building and realised there were likely to be more attackers. Faced with extreme danger, the men phoned their loved-ones.
""We decided we could not leave the scene - we could not leave these people,"" the officer said.
""I was ready to die with my team that night. I phoned my girlfriend to say goodbye.""
Elite police units soon arrived at the scene. Two other attackers who took people hostage in the concert hall eventually died in a final police assault hours later.
They were later identified as Frenchmen Omar Ismail Mostefai, 29, and Samy Amimour, 28.

""Everybody wants to see the 100m go but the 200m is for me,"" he said.
""If I can get a perfect season where I'm working well, without any injuries, with no time off, I'll definitely have the chance to break the 100m world record.

He had been carrying out work to build a fishing lake.
Mr Boyce has been given a £90,000 grant from England Heritage, but feels there should be more support for landowners who find themselves in his position.
Landowners are responsible for the initial exploration costs of excavations found on their property, and the cost rises if human remains are discovered and have to be excavated.
Mr Boyce told BBC Inside Out: ""History has been changed (by the discovery) but you've seriously got to weigh up the costs. To nearly lose your house, that's massive.""
Will Fletcher, inspector of ancient monuments for Norfolk, Suffolk and Bedfordshire for Historic England, said: ""We tried to operate as quickly as we could and provide some support to Gary because obviously he was in a very difficult position.""
Tim Pestell, the curator of Archaeology at Norwich Castle, said it was an unusual discovery.
""Because the site was so unique, it is nationally significant. Great Ryburgh will go down in the academic textbooks as an example of an early Christian community,"" he said.
""The landowner got unlucky because it was so wonderful, it wasn't expected. That's why Historic England has put thousands of pounds into rescuing that site.""
It is hoped that some of the artefacts will eventually go on display at Norwich Castle along with one of the coffins, after it has been sent to York for conservation.

The incident came hours after three foreign tourists were stabbed by suspected IS militants who stormed a hotel in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada on Friday.
Egypt is battling an insurgency largely based in the Sinai Peninsula which became more active after the overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.
Hundreds of security force members and government personnel have been killed, with attacks creeping closer to the capital Cairo.
The instability has threatened Egypt's important tourism industry.

22882655,"Dwr Cymru Welsh Water also announced that finance director Chris Jones will be taking on the chief executive role when Nigel Annett steps down.
The firm, with three million customers, said it had kept bills to the same level in real terms as in 2001.
Meanwhile, research by Cardiff University claims the company is worth £1bn a year to the Welsh economy.
Its financial results come in a different form to companies with shares on the stock market.
It is owned by the not-for-profit company Glas Cymru and savings or efficiencies are ploughed back into Dwr Cymru or used to keep bills as low as possible.
Mr Annett, with Mr Jones, founded Glas Cymru 12 years ago, and he said the idea stems from the notion that having a public service company, which is a monopoly, being run on the basis of profit maximisation for shareholders does not work in the customers' interest.
He said there were cases where the Glas Cymru non-profit model of ownership could work elsewhere in other businesses and industries.
Mr Jones said of the job awaiting him: ""There are some big challenges ahead.
""We're a company that has to have a long-term vision, looking to invest in assets that will be around for the next for the next 20, 30 and 40 years, so we have to make the right decisions.
""We have to balance that investment with the need to strive to keep bills down for our customers as well because everyone is feeling the pinch in difficult circumstances.""
Research also published on Thursday by Cardiff Business School said that Dwr Cymru contributes £1bn into the Welsh economy every year.
The study claims for every £1 spent by the company, another 56p is generated for the rest of the Welsh economy.
The report also quotes the water regulator Ofwat saying that between 2009/10 and 2014/15 Dwr Cymru customers face the lowest increase in average household bills of all water and sewerage companies in England and Wales.
On top of the £338m spent on infrastructure last year, the company is committing another £650m over the next two years, which it is argued will employ 1,000 construction workers.
The company has also reported that their financial reserves amount to £1.6bn, that's a tenfold increase compared with 2001 when Dwr Cymru was taken over by Glas Cymru.
Dwr Cymru's borrowing or gearing has also come down. It now stands at 63% compared with 65% last year and 93% in 2001.","Welsh Water put £338m into capital projects in the past year, up £76m on 2012, its financial results show."
31085912,"His 2016 budget would impose a one-off 14% tax on US profits stashed overseas, as well as a 19% tax on any future profits as they are earned.
The $238bn (Â£158bn) raised would be used to fund road projects in the US.
But analysts say it is unlikely the Republican-controlled Congress will approve the proposals.
Mr Obama told broadcaster NBC that despite several years of economic improvement, wages and incomes for middle class families were ""just now ticking up"".
""They haven't been keeping pace over the last 30 years compared to, you know, corporate profits and what's happening to folks in the very top,"" he said.
Research firm Audit Analytics calculated last April that US firms in total had $2.1tn-worth of profits stashed abroad.
It found US conglomerate General Electric had the most profit stored overseas at $110bn.  Tech giants Microsoft and Apple and drugs companies Pfizer and Merck all featured in the top five.
No tax is currently due on foreign profits as long as they are not brought into the US.
As a result some companies put their earnings in low tax jurisdictions and simply leave them there.
The White House said its plans for an immediate 14% tax would raise $238bn, which would be used to fund a wider $478bn public works programme of road, bridge and public transport upgrades.
""This transition tax would mean that companies have to pay US tax right now on the $2tn  they already have overseas, rather than being able to delay paying any US tax indefinitely,"" a White House official said.
The official said that after this one-off tax, the 19% permanent tax firms would have to pay on overseas profits ""would level the playing field, and encourage firms to create jobs here at home.""
The tax rate is far lower than the current US top corporate tax rate of 35%.
Also expected in Mr Obama's budget proposal is a tax cut on earned incomes, including tax credits for child care and ""second earners"".
Mr Obama will also seek to ease restrictions on military and domestic spending in place since a budget deal in 2011.
Republicans in Congress have largely rejected many of Mr Obama's proposals for increased domestic spending and tax rises on corporations but support increased military spending.
Representative Paul Ryan, the Republican's top budget official, accused Mr Obama of exploiting ""envy economics"" in his proposal.
""This top down redistribution doesn't work,"" Mr Ryan told NBC.","US President Barack Obama plans to close a tax loophole that allows US firms to avoid paying taxes on overseas profits, the White House says."
40205378,"Third seed Halep won 6-4 3-6 6-3 to set up a final against unseeded Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia.
Czech second seed Pliskova would have become world number one next week had she won the second semi-final.
Ostapenko celebrated her 20th birthday with a 7-6 (7-4) 3-6 6-3 win over Switzerland's Timea Bacsinszky.
Mimi Jausovec was the last unseeded player to reach the French Open final in 1983, losing to Chris Evert.
Saturday's final will see a new Grand Slam champion crowned, and a new name at the top of the rankings should Halep win and overtake Angelique Kerber.
""It is nice to be in the final again,"" said Halep, who lost to Maria Sharapova in the 2014 French Open final.
""I hope I can play better and win it. I'm playing a young player - it is a big challenge.""
After recovering from a set and 5-1 down against Elina Svitolina in the quarter-final, Halep led from the front against Pliskova.
With the number-one ranking and the prospect of a first Grand Slam title on the line, it was Halep who grasped the opportunity.
The 25-year-old broke serve in game three as her speed and accuracy proved too much for the wayward Pliskova.
The Czech made 24 errors in losing the first set, but finally edged ahead at 4-2 in the second.
Pliskova, 25, had said throughout the tournament that she was surprised at her progress on the clay, but for half an hour her powerful hitting held sway and there was little Halep could do.
The Romanian was under pressure early in the decider but finally chased down a forehand and fired a brilliant cross-court winner to grab a 3-1 lead.
Pliskova would cut the deficit to 4-3 only to blaze a forehand long, leaving Halep to serve out the match after two hours.
Ostapenko was well into uncharted territory, ranked 47th and having never been past the third round at a Grand Slam before, but she relished the big stage.
The former Wimbledon junior champion held her nerve to become Latvia's first major finalist, and the youngest woman in a Slam final since 19-year-old Caroline Wozniacki at the 2009 US Open.
Ostapenko edged a first-set tie-break but looked to have lost her way in the second when she dropped four games in a row.
Bacsinszky was knocked out of the tournament at the semi-final stage at Roland Garros in 2015 and appeared determined to avoid the same fate as she comfortably levelled at one set all.
But Ostapenko turned on the style in the decider, edging ahead at 4-3 with the 15th break of the match before holding for 5-3.
Ostapenko then hit a winning forehand to secure her place in the final, prompting the crowd to sing ""happy birthday"" as she celebrated the biggest win of her career so far.
""I felt a little bit tight because it was a semi-final,"" she said.
""But then I was just trying to be calm and just to try to play my game and just enjoy every moment.""",Romania's Simona Halep moved within one win of a first Grand Slam title and the number one ranking with victory over Karolina Pliskova at the French Open.

In 2013 Mr Putin reportedly proposed that Seagal be made an honorary consul of Russia in California and Arizona.

But pregnant women should make sure they take folic acid and vitamin D, as well as eating a well-balanced diet, as per NHS guidelines, they add.
Supplements-makers said some women were not getting enough nutrients.
The researchers said folic acid had the strongest evidence to support its use - taking 400 micrograms a day can protect against abnormalities called neural tube defects in the developing baby.
Vitamin D - 10 micrograms a day - is recommended for healthy bones in the mother and baby.
Some women can get these two pills for free on the Healthy Start scheme.
A supplement that can be dangerous in pregnancy is vitamin A. Too much can harm the baby.
The researchers said pregnant women might feel coerced into buying expensive multivitamins in order to give their baby the best start in life.
But they would do well to resist the marketing claims, which did not seem to translate into better outcomes for mother or baby, they said.
""The only supplements recommended for all women during pregnancy are folic acid and vitamin D, which are available at relatively low cost,"" they said.
Janet Fyle, from the Royal College of Midwives, said: ""We would encourage women who are pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant to have a healthy, varied diet including fresh fruit and vegetables, alongside taking folic acid supplements.
""We would also stress that there is no need for pregnant women to 'eat for two'.
""This is a myth, and all that is required is a normal balanced amount of food.""
The Health Food Manufacturers' Association, which represents the food supplements industry, insists that a substantial proportion of women of child-bearing age are not getting enough nutrients from diet alone.

But Warburton played down accusations that their goal-scoring has dried up, and pointed to their goal difference of 31 after 14 games, which he said speaks volumes about the potency of his squad.
""Other teams have gone on a very, very good run of form and teams who dropped points at the start of the season have put a run together,"" he said.
""All credit to them as it's hard to put a run together at any time in football. So I don't think it's Rangers' form dipping, it's other teams improving.
""If we are 10, 11 or 12 points clear and we lose three games of football, while the other teams win their games, then I would agree (there is a crisis).
Rangers currently sit level with Hibernian on points at the Championship summit, topping the table on goal difference, but have a game in hand over the Edinburgh outfit.
The two meet next at Ibrox on 28 December and, while it is on his radar, Warburton said they will not take their eye off the ball in preparation for that clash.
""I think it's dangerous to do that, and that's the natural outlook I understand that perfectly and everyone will be saying all eyes are on the 28th, but I think we've got to look at the fact that that's a banana skin - you've got to watch games in between.
""There's no point focussing on the game four or five weeks ahead if you drop points in the meantime.""
Striker Martyn Waghorn, meanwhile, who has scored 17 goals in Rangers' 14 league fixtures, is not worried about finding the net.
""We've not been as clinical in front of goal or not scored as many goals as we could have, but that's down to other teams sitting in more defensively, holding their shape and making it difficult for us,"" he said.
""But we've only lost one game and everyone is saying we're going through a slump - that's crazy, but something we've got to deal with.
""It gives us a challenge on a Saturday, how to break teams down and find different ways to score.""
Waghorn believes the current pressure is simply part and parcel of playing for Rangers; he too welcomes the competition at the top of the Championship.
""Hibs are level with us now and it's going to be a challenge to see if they can keep up so let's see how it pans out the next weeks,"" he added.","Rangers manager Mark Warburton denies his side are enduring a slump in form, and said their recent goal-scoring record is down to tougher defences."
39719512,"There were 1,500 earthquakes recorded in Edinburgh and the Lothians over the same period.
The largest earthquake in the Lothians was in Rosewell on 9 October 1986 with a 2.8 magnitude on the Richter Scale.
Among the other areas with the most geological activity were Clackmannanshire and Dumfries.
A seismometer at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh records earthquakes within a 30km (19 miles) radius.
More recently there was a 2.2 magnitude earthquake recorded in Penicuik in Midlothian on 13 November 2014.
There were two 2.3 magnitude earthquakes in Penicuik on 30 November and 9 December 2007.
Davie Galloway, British Geological Survey seismologist, told the BBC Scotland news website, that an earthquake over 2 magnitude would feel like a lorry passing your house and it would make windows rattle.
He said: ""People think we don't get earthquakes because we are not on the edge of a plate but we do.
""Although we sit on the middle of a plate on the earth's crust we still have earthquakes although not on the same magnitude as for example Japan.
""We also get them in old mining areas. If the stress exceeds the strength of the rock then it can create an earthquake.""
The largest-known earthquake to ever hit the UK had a magnitude of 6.1 on 7 June 1931 in the North Sea.
It was felt across most of Britain with damage reported from 71 different places.
Ben Flanagan at Esri UK, said: ""We wanted to examine where Scotland's earthquakes occurred to see if any patterns emerged and uncover the myth that the country doesn't get that many.
""Modern mapping techniques enabled us to plot all 10,000 across the UK and reveal Scotland's areas of highest seismic activity.""","There were more than 4,000 earthquakes recorded across Scotland over the past 50 years, including  a 4.4 magnitude quake in Knoydart Peninsula in 1974."

Barbados is one of the more populous and prosperous Caribbean islands. Political, economic and social stability have given it one of the highest standards of living in the developing world. As well as being a centre for financial services, it also has offshore reserves of oil and natural gas.
However, the economy took something of a knock in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. The country's public debt rose sharply in 2009-11, mainly because of a slowdown in the tourism and financial services sectors.
Prior to the economic crisis there was a construction boom, with new hotels and housing complexes springing up. The trend accelerated as the island prepared to host some of the key Cricket World Cup matches in 2007.
However, a shortage of jobs has prompted many Barbadians - more often known as Bajans - to find work abroad. The money that they send home is an important source of income.
Most Barbadians are the descendants of African slaves who were brought to the island from the 17th century to work the sugar cane plantations.
Limestone caverns, coral reefs and a warm climate tempered by trade winds are among the island's natural assets. Barbados is relatively flat, with highlands in the interior.","The eastern Caribbean nation of Barbados was historically heavily dependent on the export of sugar as its main revenue earner, but in recent decades the economy has diversified into tourism and offshore finance."
34931378,"Some see in this the potential for a new era in Russian-French relations. Maybe not the strategic alliance of old, but certainly an end to the modern-day chill.
Events have certainly moved quickly. A year ago France was in the middle of a nasty spat over warships which it was refusing to sell to Vladimir Putin.
For France, the Russian leader was a destabilising presence on Europe's eastern borders. EU sanctions - intended to contain Russian ambitions in Crimea and Ukraine - had full French backing.
Today there are more pressing concerns.
In the wake of the Paris attacks, President Hollande had a vision of a single, united international coalition - the nations of the world working together to eradicate IS.
Realities have since deflated that ambition. The Americans and the Russians are not going to work together any time soon. And the Turko-Russian crisis over the downed Sukhoi Russian warplane is a further complication.
But still, the French want as many countries on side as possible. And the Russians - by dint of their military presence in Syria - are a major player.
As one diplomatic official told Le Monde: ""Right now we are probably more prepared to work with the Russians than Barack Obama is.""
President Hollande has two goals in his talks with Vladimir Putin.
First he wants to persuade Russia to direct its airstrikes away from the ""moderate"" Syrian opposition and onto targets belonging to IS.
Second, he wants a firmer understanding that Russia will not stick indefinitely behind Bashar al-Assad.
The French feel they have made a significant change in policy by de-prioritising the removal of the Syrian leader.
It took a good deal of pride-swallowing to make the concession, because until two weeks ago Paris was President Assad's greatest scourge.
But there is only so far that the French will go down this line. And they feel Russia should also give some slack.
There are a number of factors in favour of a rapprochement.
First of all, Russia has itself now come face-to-face with IS terrorism - with the destruction of the tourist plane from Sharm el-Sheikh.
This has jolted perceptions in Moscow, for which IS is now a designated enemy.
Second, Russia has every interest in cultivating Paris as a new friend.
Straight after the Paris attacks, Mr Putin ordered his military to co-ordinate with the French in the campaign against IS - an unprecedented act given that France is in Nato.
The Russian leader was effusive with compassion, and even sent a dog - Dobrynya - to replace Diesel the French special forces Alsatian who was killed in the raid in Saint Denis.
It was all very deliberate, because there is nothing the Russians would like more than to lure the French out of the American-Western orbit.
In the geopolitics departments of Russian universities - and some French ones too - this is regarded as a historically-determined necessity.
France and Russia, after all, are two great nations lying at either end of the European continent - with a shared interest in preventing its domination either by outsiders (the US) or insiders (Germany).
Throughout the last three centuries the two countries have been periodic allies - notably in the run-up to World War One.
But also President Charles de Gaulle himself - though viscerally anti-Communist - kept his distance from the Americans by flirting with the Soviet Union.
What could be more natural - say Kremlin insiders - than for France to resume its natural role, triangulating between Washington and Moscow?
But tempting as this might sound to some in France, there is no geostrategic shift in the offing.
For one thing the French do not trust Vladimir Putin.
For another, the two countries still have opposing visions on too many key issues.
France will never abandon Ukraine. And in the Middle East, France's allies are the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia - not the Shia axis backed by Russia.
There is a concordance of interests bringing Paris and Moscow together. With luck, this will help in the battle against IS.
But there is no new alliance.","French President Francois Hollande's visit to Moscow comes at a time of fast-shifting diplomatic alignments and priorities, triggered by the spread of Islamic State (IS) terror."

The figures emerged after a Freedom of Information request by BBC Look North.

Aidan said that when he came out as a boy his mother was ""definitely heartbroken"".
""I feel like she had dreams of seeing her daughter getting married and having children,"" he said. ""She definitely needed time to mourn and I needed to let her have that time.""

When he told the school he did not want to be addressed as a girl or wear girl's clothes, he claims staff said it was a ""phase"" that he would grow out of.
He said he was told he was ""attention seeking"". ""They didn't really take it seriously,"" he added.
Mother Jackie described the school's treatment as ""appalling"".
""They made my child out to be a freak and someone who would contaminate other students,"" she claimed.
A letter from Aidan's mother to the school's chair of governors says she had no choice but to remove her son from the school after being told the school was ""inadequately prepared to accommodate Aidan's needs and give him the high level of support and pastoral care that he deserves"".
The legal action is currently ongoing through the courts.
It is understood part of the school's defence claims Aidan was withdrawn from the school by his family, prior to a final decision being made by them about whether his needs could be met.
In a statement Hereford Cathedral School said: ""The continued happiness, wellbeing and safety of our pupils is the top priority.

39478466,"The American, who cannot be identified, said the therapy for Charlie Gard would be ""treatment but not a cure"".
A decision whether to turn off his life support machines is being considered by the High Court.
Connie Yates and Chris Gard want to take their son who has progressive muscle weakness to the US.
A crowdfunding campaign for the trip is now less than £60,000 short of its £1.3m target.
The judge is analysing medical evidence at a hearing in the Family Division before deciding what option is in Charlie's best interests.
The neurologist who would oversee the treatment told the court that while Charlie was in the ""terminal stage"" of his illness, treating him would be compassionate.
He said the therapy, which would be tried for six months, would provide a ""small chance"" of a meaningful improvement in Charlie's brain function.
""[Charlie] may be able to interact. To smile. To look at objects,"" he said.
Sophia Roper, representing Charlie's parents, also told the court there was ""no evidence that he is on a regular basis in pain"".
Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital said the baby receives 24-hour care and should be allowed to die with dignity.
But the couple, who live in London, believe seven-month-old Charlie may have a chance of surviving if he receives treatment abroad.
""We just want to have our chance. It would never be a cure but it could help him live. If it saves him, amazing,"" Miss Yates said.
""I want to save others. Even if Charlie doesn't make it through this, I don't ever want another mum and their child to go through this.""
Though born healthy in August, Charlie began to lose weight and strength by the time he was eight weeks old.
He was admitted to Great Ormond Street in October after developing aspiration pneumonia and was diagnosed with mitochondrial depletion syndrome.
Last month, his parents told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme they would continue to fight for their child's survival.
They said: ""He can move his mouth, he can move his hands. He can't open them fully, but he can still open his eyes and see us, in response to us.""
An online campaign raised an initial £1.2m, but an extra £100,000 is now needed to help pay fees on the GoFundMe website and extend Charlie's stay in America.
While it is free to host a campaign on GoFundMe.com, fees are deducted from each donation.
In the UK 5% of each donation goes towards supporting GoFundMe, while 2.68% is charged for processing fees plus VAT.
Those paying towards UK-based campaigns from outside the European Economic Area can expect up to 9.48% of their donation to go towards these fees, the website says.
Charlie is thought to be just one of 16 children in the world to have mitochondrial depletion syndrome.
Earlier this month, a spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust said it had ""exhausted"" all proven treatment options.
""We cannot imagine how hugely distressing this is for his family,"" they added.
""We continue to support them in every way we can, while advocating, what we believe, is best for Charlie.""","The doctor who would give experimental treatment to a baby who has a rare genetic condition has admitted the case was ""uncharted territory""."

""If we want to go head-to-head with those major tournaments, that's a decision we can make but we should make it in an informed way and understand what that really means.""
The chief executive also highlighted the possible economic impact of changing the Scottish season.
""I think we need to look at other league formats that result in fewer games and that might create more flexibility to take games out of the worst of the winter weather,"" he said.
""I think most managers would agree that we play too many games but the problem with shortening the season is the knock-on impact on income, so it's much easier said than done.
""We can't simply create a winter break if we are using 11 months at the moment. We played seven [rounds of Premiership] games in January this year, not because we wanted to but because of the constraints.
""Unless there is a debate around how many games we play and the league structure, there is very little scope to alter the current calendar.""

Someone has planted a minuscule vegetable patch beneath a tree (Jardin Debout!).
One banner calls for a new French constitution. Another proclaims the ""convergence des luttes"" - the ultimate left-wing dream: the coming together of all the struggles.
It is like wandering through a university campus during a sit-in. The same mixture of wide-eyed joy and po-faced earnestness. The same thrashing out of texts that no-one will read. The same evanescent self-importance.
All of which would be perfectly unexceptionable, were it not for the fact that - this being France - the Nuit Debout movement has been accorded a public status that it does not remotely deserve.
The  media - with rare exceptions - have been predictably breathless in their reporting of this ""democratic awakening"".
The impression is put about that la jeunesse (the youth) is once again - as in May 1968 - doing a service to society by reclaiming debate from a decrepit political establishment.
Worse, the politicians themselves go along with this myth. No-one dares say boo to a ""popular manifestation"" that borrows its imagery from the country's revolutionary past. Even some right-wing politicians have said they are ""solidaire"".
The crowning irony is that - in the face of la jeunesse en colere (angry youth) - the Socialist government has already made major concessions.
The origin of Nuit Debout was the protest movement against Prime Minister Manuel Valls's vaguely pro-business new labour law.
But under pressure from President Hollande (who is petrified by the prospect of youth on the streets), Valls has not just removed the more contentious clauses - he has also offered 500 million euros a year in new grants for the young.
There is even talk now of extending welfare payments that normally kick in at 25  to 18-year-olds - even though the cost of that would be a ruinous six billion euros a year. This in a country committed - supposedly - to bringing down its deficit of 70 billion euros.
In reality, Hollande has made a very political calculation. Though protests against the labour law will no doubt continue, their bite has been removed.
The threat is over, and he can keep alive - for now - the fiction that he will be the left's natural candidate in next year's presidential race.
Meanwhile, the Nuit Debout movement will remain as a dwindling, harmless legacy of the president's last bid to reform. Harmless, because the Place de la Republique protesters are now static, tame and increasingly absorbed in their utopian irrelevance.
But the deeper lesson of the episode is more troubling.
France is a country prone to self-deception. Its obsession with the symbols of a revolutionary past blinds it to the realities of an undesired present.
Movements like Nuit Debout sustain the delusion that left-wing ideas are thriving. They are not.
The country is increasingly moving to the populist right - not least out of exasperation at a discredited orthodoxy.","Since the end of March, hundreds of people have been gathering every evening in the Place de la Republique in Paris."

Essex Police said there were still ""unanswered"" questions over Mr Lubbock's death.
Michael Barrymore: How the British TV king lost his crown
A figure for the damages to be paid to Mr Barrymore - whose real name is Michael Parker - is yet to be set.
Mr Barrymore was arrested in 2007 in connection with the 31-year-old's death.
Mr Justice Stuart-Smith, sitting in London on Friday, ruled against the force, which had argued Mr Barrymore should only receive a nominal payout.
The judge did not decide on the sum to be awarded, as his ruling dealt only with the preliminary issue of the level of damages to be awarded to Mr Barrymore.
The case centred on whether Essex Police had reasonable grounds to lawfully arrest Mr Barrymore.
While Mr Justice Stuart-Smith found there was ""information available to the police that could have provided an arresting officer with reasonable grounds for a lawful arrest"" the one officer with sufficient information to carry it out was not there at the time the entertainer was arrested.
That officer was stuck in traffic at the time, Essex Police said.
As a result, said Mr Justice Stuart-Smith, the arrest was unlawful and Mr Barrymore was therefore ""entitled to recover more than nominal damages"".
During a previous hearing, a lawyer for Mr Barrymore told how the arrest had affected his client.
Hugh Tomlinson QC said Mr Barrymore, the former host of My Kind Of People and Strike it Lucky, was never charged with any offence and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) later made it ""crystal clear"" there was no basis for any charges.
He said Mr Barrymore remained convinced that Mr Lubbock's injuries were not caused at his home but he did not know what happened.
He added: ""This arrest was made without any proper evidential foundation.
""However, the fact that it had happened, and the worldwide publicity it received, destroyed the claimant's career.""
In a statement issued after the High Court hearing, Essex Police said: ""Today's judgement must not overshadow the questions which are still unanswered for Mr Lubbock's family and friends.
""Sixteen years on they still need to know what happened to Stuart on that night, how he was injured, and who is responsible for his death.
""A small number of people know the answers to those questions and over the years loyalties change and somebody may want to help us at this time.""","The entertainer Michael Barrymore is to get ""more than nominal damages"" after claiming his wrongful arrest by police destroyed his career."

""Those people stole my life but the outcome of today's trial means that they will now face the justice that they deserve.""
Judge Neil Bidder QC said the three Connors, who operated a tarmacking business based at a farm in Rumney, treated their victims as little more than objects.
He said: ""All the offences which you, Patrick Joseph Connors, have been convicted of are examples of conduct designed to keep two vulnerable men in what can only be described as modern-day slavery - in the case of Michael John Hughes, for 21 years.
""By the end of that time he had been completely conditioned to being used by you as a serf.""
The court heard over the course of the trial, Patrick Joseph Connors forced Mr Hughes to work for him for long hours, paying him tiny sums or just with alcohol and tobacco.
Mr Hughes was ""hunted down"" when he escaped and beaten ""all the time"", he said in evidence.
He was made to live in ""appalling conditions"", including in a 1.2m (4ft)-wide garden shed with no heating or running water for two years.
The court heard the only respite came when Mr Hughes was sent back to Scotland for unpaid fines and jailed. He said prison was ""like a holiday camp"" compared to his ordeal in Wales.
Connors senior was also convicted of eight counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), four of kidnap and one charge of conspiracy to kidnap, while Patrick Dean Connors was also found guilty of kidnap.
The jury was told to return not guilty verdicts on a charge of conspiracy to kidnap against Patrick Dean Connors and another of assault against William Connors.
Gwent Police's Ch Supt Paul Griffiths, who led the investigation, said: ""These types of crimes have a lasting effect on the victims - it is not just the physical degradation, it's psychological too. It causes deep and long-lasting trauma.""",Three family members have been jailed for forcing a man to do heavy labour for tiny amounts in Cardiff.
39254394,"The General Penitentiary of Venezuela in central Guarico state was closed in October after violent clashes between inmates.
The bodies, which are in an advanced state of decomposition, were found during works to refurbish the jail.
So far none of the remains have been identified.
The grave was discovered on Thursday and the number of bodies found since has risen from seven to 14.
Forensic experts are continuing with their search and have not ruled out finding more bodies buried on the prison grounds.
On Friday, prison minister Iris Varela wrote on Twitter that she had contacted the relatives of two inmates to ask for their help identifying the remains.
The two prisoners disappeared when inmates were relocated from the General Penitentiary of Venezuela to other jails in October.
An estimated 9,000 prisoners were locked up in the jail near the town of San Juan de los Morros prior to its closure, according to non-governmental organisation A Window on Freedom.
The NGO says Venezuelan jails are woefully overcrowded and that last year 173 inmates died while in custody.
But Ms Varela told Venezuelan state broadcaster VTV that the country had taken huge steps to improve the conditions of its prisons.
She said that all of the country's women's and youth prisons had been brought up to new standards set by the Venezuelan government.
""This is an achievement without precedent of the Bolivarian Revolution and the government of our president, Nicolas Maduro,"" she said.
She said that President Maduro had asked her in 2014 to ""impose maximum discipline"" in Venezuelan jails.
""Well, here I am fulfilling the president's orders,"" she said.
She did not refer further to the remains found except to say that forensic tests were being carried out.","The number of bodies found in a mass grave in Venezuela's largest prison has risen to 14, the public prosecutor's office said in a statement."
35118927,"""The Turks"", he said, had ""decided to lick the Americans in a certain place"".
He was giving his wide-ranging annual news conference.
Touching on next year's US presidential election, the Russian leader called Donald Trump a ""very colourful, talented person"" and the ""absolute frontrunner in the presidential race"".
Mr Putin is now into his third term as president since 2000, battling an economic crisis. Critics say civil liberties have been steadily eroded under his rule.
He remains one of the world's most recognisable politicians, and has topped the list of The World's Most Powerful People compiled by Forbes magazine for the third year running.
On other issues raised at the news conference, President Putin
Russia deployed its air force to Syria in September in support of President Bashar al-Assad and has been carrying out air strikes on his opponents.
Its intervention has been heavily criticised by Turkey, the US and Gulf Arab states.
Mr Putin said the downing of the Russian jet by Turkish warplanes on the Syria-Turkey border was a ""hostile act"" but Russia was ""not the country"" to run away.
He said he saw ""no prospect"" of ties improving with Turkey - which Russia has put under sanctions - under its current leaders.
There was, he said, a ""creeping Islamisation of Turkey that would have Ataturk rolling in his grave"".
The remark appeared to be aimed at President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose AKP party, with its Islamist roots, has been accused of seeking to dismantle the secular state founded by Kemal Ataturk.
Mr Putin said Turkish officials should have picked up the phone to talk to Russia about their concerns that air strikes in Syria were hitting Turkmen rebels.
Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president
Ever noticed that Russian President Vladimir Putin has an unusual walking style? He does not swing his right arm much at all when he walks - instead all the movement is on the left side of the body, giving him a very distinct lop-sided gait.
A team of European neurologists analysed countless YouTube videos of the president and other top Russian officials to find out why.
They discovered that they all had a similar gait, and it is probably linked to their KGB military training which requires them to keep their weapons close to their chest or in the right hand, giving them time to draw a gun on an unexpected enemy. As a result, only the left arm moves freely.
So President Putin officially has a ""gunslinger's gait"" - but doctors should be aware that a reduced right arm swing can also be an early sign of Parkinson's disease too, the British Medical Journal research says.
Is there such a thing as a 'hard man' walk?
Mr Putin insisted his country's economy was recovering.
While oil prices had fallen sharply, he said, manufacturing had shown slight growth and there was a healthy trade balance in agriculture.
""Our economy depends on oil and gas prices, we expected Brent to be worth $100 per barrel, but then it was $50, but this was an optimistic prediction too, our forecasts have to be amended again,"" Mr Putin said.
""GDP is falling, inflation is 12.3%, incomes, investment are falling too but the peak of the economic crisis is over.""
Mr Putin is known for his marathon performances at his news conferences, where he frequently uses hard-hitting, colourful language.
This year's event lasted three hours and seven minutes - three minutes shorter than last year's.
The record for a Putin news conference was set in 2008, at four hours 40 minutes.
Putin's Ukraine 'admission': Analysis by Olexiy Solohubenko, BBC News
""We never said there were no people there who were carrying out certain tasks, including in the military sphere,"" President Putin told the annual news conference.
It is an important admission. After months of denial, insisting that the only Russians fighting in eastern Ukraine were either ""volunteers"" or ""army servicemen on holidays"", Mr Putin now says Russian military personnel are on the ground and are involved in the fighting.
He still maintains ""there are no Russian troops there"" and insists there is a difference. However the distinction may be very blurred for Ukrainian soldiers facing the Russian-backed separatists and Russian military personnel, as has now been admitted.
Whether the Russian servicemen are attached to the separatist units, or are there as commanders, trainers or advisers and are not on the ground as regular units, is in many ways a technicality. What President  Putin has admitted is that Russia is present in eastern Ukraine and is engaged in military activity.
It may be stating the obvious, but the way this admission has been made is not new.
For many months, President Putin denied Russian troops being involved in the takeover of the Crimea - he called the heavily armed soldiers seen there in modern uniforms without insignia, dubbed ""green men"", a local self-defence force.
But earlier this year, he told Russian TV that he had instructed his special forces (spetsnaz) to get directly involved in the annexation.",Russian President Vladimir Putin has used crude language in a furious new attack on Turkey over the shooting down of a Russian combat jet last month.

Around 100,000 people in the United Kingdom have multiple sclerosis or MS, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Society.
It is normally diagnosed in people between the ages of 20 and 40.
Symptoms might include fatigue, vision problems and difficulties with walking, but MS is different for everyone.
In MS, the protective layer surrounding nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord - known as myelin - becomes damaged. The immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin, causing scarring or sclerosis.
The damaged myelin disrupts the nerve signals - rather like the short circuit caused by a frayed electrical cable.
If the process of inflammation and scarring is not treated, then eventually the condition can cause permanent neurodegeneration.
Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of the MS Society, said: ""MS is an unpredictable and challenging condition to live with and diagnosis can be upsetting and scary. The MS Society is here to help anyone affected by MS.""

Unconfirmed reports say some of the assailants have blown themselves up. The officials say the dead include one US and one French citizen.
The security forces say the stand-off has now been brought to an end.
The US state department has confirmed the death of a US citizen, without giving any further details. The dead American is believed to have been a security contractor.
The French national is reported to have been working for Libya's Buraq Air.
There are conflicting reports as to the total number of attackers.
A Twitter account linked to Islamic State said the militant group had carried out the attack.
There has been strong evidence to suggest an IS presence in the eastern Libyan city of Derna since October, with a group there publicly declaring allegiance to its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
However, the command structure is still a mystery to most foreign observers.
The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli says that in the past month there has been a string of incidents in western Libya, including abductions and bombings, that have been claimed by IS social media accounts.
But she says it has not been clearly established whether these groups are IS foot soldiers or people inspired by them.
A civilian who witnessed the attack told the BBC: ""I suddenly heard shots and saw people running towards me, and we all escaped from the back [of the hotel] through the underground garage. The hotel did a lockdown after that.""
Analysis: BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli
The militant group Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Corinthia Hotel, which was housing Omar al-Hassi, prime minister of Tripoli's self-proclaimed government, and the makeshift offices of an unknown number of foreign companies. Although this cannot be verified with absolute certainty, the brutality and style of the siege suggests it was the work of extremists targeting foreigners.
Libya is in a state of political chaos with a security vacuum and there are few reliable sources with whom to check facts.  On a day when Tripoli witnessed this brazen and deadly attack, reporters were faced with statements from competing political blocs who seemingly tried to capitalise on the incident.
Mr al-Hassi claimed he was the target. The elected government in the east will use it to make the case for broadening their crackdown on Islamist groups - which some blame for further radicalising some of them.
What it has shown is that this lawless land is making it easy for extremist groups to mushroom.
Different sources at the scene said there were between three and five attackers - footage released later on Tuesday showed the body of a man reported to be one of the militants.
A security source told the BBC that one gunman had been arrested. Four security guards are among the dead and several people are reported to be injured.
One hotel employee told the Associated Press news agency that the hotel was mostly empty at the time of the attack.
Meanwhile, a hotel security source told the BBC that the hotel had received a threat ""a few days ago"" warning managers ""to empty the building"".
Housing the few foreigners who remain in the Libyan capital has long been known to be risky, our correspondent says.
The Corinthia Hotel is used by foreign diplomats, government officials and foreign companies. The UN Support Mission in Libya (Unsmil) has hosted several workshops at the hotel.
Libyan internationally recognised Prime Minister Abdullah Al-Thinni condemned the attack and pledged that those responsible for it would be brought to justice.
Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign affairs chief, also condemned the attack which took place as a second round of peace talks between Libya's warring factions ended in Geneva in what the UN described as a ""positive atmosphere"".
The Twitter account linked to IS said the group had carried out the attack in revenge for the death of Abu Anas al-Liby, a Libyan jihadist who was suspected of involvement in the bombings of two US embassies in East Africa in 1998.
Liby died in a US hospital on 2 January, days before he was due to stand trial.

Lawyers for the estate this week confirmed a number of unnamed relatives have been barred from visiting the Jackson family home.
Writing in his statement about the confrontation at the Jackson family home on 23 July, Jermaine said ""it was clear that mutual suspicions had allowed events to spiral out of control"".
""I regret that events were ever allowed to reach such a stage,"" he wrote. ""I regret any distress caused to Prince, Paris and Blanket. That was never, ever the intention of myself, Janet, Rebbie or Randy.""

22850124,"Mr Morsi said he was not ""calling for war"", but that he would not allow Egypt's water supply to be endangered.
Egypt was apparently caught by surprise when Ethiopia started diverting the Blue Nile last month, amid works to construct a hydroelectric dam.
The river is a tributary of the Nile, on which Egypt is heavily dependent.
The Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is a $4.7bn (Â£3.1bn) project that Ethiopia says will eventually provide 6,000 megawatts of power.
It says the Blue Nile will be slightly diverted but will then be able to follow its natural course.
""Egypt's water security cannot be violated at all,"" Mr Morsi said on Monday. ""As president of the state, I confirm to you that all options are open.""
""If Egypt is the Nile's gift, then the Nile is a gift to Egypt,'' he said, quoting popular sayings about the river in an emotive televised speech.
""The lives of the Egyptians are connected around it... as one great people. If it diminishes by one drop then our blood is the alternative.""
Analysts say Mr Morsi could be using the issue to distract attention from severe domestic political and economic challenges.
Egypt is particularly dependant on water supply from the Nile, and its growing population has been placing that supply under increasing strain.
Sudan is also reliant on Nile waters.
Egypt cites a colonial era ruling to claim a right to the majority of the Nile's waters for itself and Sudan, but Ethiopia says the ruling is outdated.
Mr Morsi said Egypt had no objection to development projects on Nile basin states, ""but on condition that those projects do not affect or damage Egypt's legal and historical rights"".
Last week, Egyptian politicians were inadvertently heard on live TV proposing military action over the dam.","Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi has said ""all options are open"" to deal with any threat to his country's water supply posed by an Ethiopian dam."
36738196,"An independent Rugby Football League tribunal ruled on charges brought in April, and an independent body upheld the verdict on Thursday.

""I have no doubt whatsoever the RFL are out to get Salford at every opportunity as long as I'm involved in the club, and the six-point deduction is very harsh,"" continued Koukash.
""It's as harsh as it was a couple of years ago when they deducted a couple of points from the club for fielding 14 players.
""When we saw it a few weeks ago, Widnes did it twice and they got a fine, so we can see that they have been targeting Salford for quite a while.
""That's probably due to the fact that I'm outspoken against them and they see me as a person who is not welcome in the sport. If that's the case then maybe I shouldn't be in the sport.""
After the Red Devils were initially charged in March, Koukash had promised ""all-out war"" if his club were punished by the RFL.
In 2013, Salford were fined £5,000 and deducted two points for fielding 14 men during their 34-30 win over Castleford, while Widnes beat Hull FC 46-6 earlier this season when had an extra man on the field.
When asked for a response to Koukash's comments, the RFL responded with the same statement released after Salford's appeal was rejected.

One of the main points of the appeal was that the independent tribunal found Salford guilty on undeclared payments which Koukash conceded were not registered.
Wigan were the last club to be found in breach of the salary cap in 2007 and they were docked four points, compared to Salford's six.
""What we couldn't get away from was yes, there were three undeclared payments dating back in 2013 and 2014, two of them for [helping the players pay] rent,"" added Koukash.
""They could be argued due to admin or mismanagement - that's why we are getting the six points deduction, for breaking operational rules and not the salary cap itself.
""If you add the three undeclared payments to our spend we do not go over the salary cap. I think it is unfair. Yes, we did not declare the payments, but is it a six-point deduction?

14294642,"But the independent report voiced concern that no clear scientific, medical or social benefits had emerged from nearly one in 10 projects.
It also said that in a minority of experiments, the justification for using monkeys was ""not compelling"".
The review was led by Professor Sir Patrick Bateson.
The current president of the Zoological Society of London was commissioned by the main bodies that fund medical research in Britain.
They wanted him to assess whether the studies on non-human primates (NHPs) were necessary, high-quality and yielded significant advances in medical science.
Animal welfare groups opposed to experimentation on monkeys called again for the practice to be banned outright.  They described Prof Bateson's review a ""chilling insight into primate research"".
Although the proportion of monkeys used in research compared with other animals is low, less than 0.1%, there is concern that they suffer more than other species during experimentation, and so should only be used if those studies are expected to yield important medical benefits and if there is no other way of carrying out the research.
The review suggested that this standard might not have been achieved in all cases.  ""Not everything is rosy in the garden,"" Prof Bateson told reporters.
He reviewed experiments on monkeys carried out between  January 1997 and December 2006. Just under 3,000 animals were used in experiments in that period.
The bulk of the research focused on neuroscience. Research on great apes is not permitted in the UK and so monkeys provide the next best animal models to study the human brain.
Researchers often cite the widespread prevalence of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as a justification for research in this area.
However, Prof Bateson said that the ""size of the problem should not be accepted as the sole justification for individual areas of research"".
He added: ""Funders and researchers should avoid overstating and generalising the medical benefit (of research on monkeys). Instead, statements should be based on the actual scientific basis for funding decisions.""
Considerable suffering
Prof Bateson and his team looked at 31 neuroscience studies. Half of the experiments involved considerable animal suffering. These were assessed as having a high scientific value.
But in most cases, according to Prof Bateson, there was ""little direct evidence of medical benefit"". He did concede, though, that there might not have been sufficient time for the advances gained in scientific understanding to be translated into new drugs or treatments.
The report recommends a body to be set up to assess whether commissioned research will lead to improvements in healthcare.
Prof Bateson's review found a few instances of research that caused a high degree of suffering, but was not judged to be the highest-quality science.
One example was of UK-funded research on reproduction carried out overseas.
It involved performing a hysterectomy in which the mother and its foetus were, in the words of the review, ""compromised"". The study was undertaken to train students and repeated a study that had been carried out a decade earlier.
According to Prof Bateson, ""it is not acceptable knowingly to fund work outside the UK that would not be legally responsible or ethically acceptable in the UK"".
The report also said scientists had a ""moral responsibility"" to publish all their results on experiments involving monkeys even if they were not positive or not deemed interesting.
Research results are often not published when the experiments do not yield positive results, but Prof Bateson's point is that because some of these details are not put in the public domain, it could lead to other researchers repeating the experiments and so causing unnecessary suffering.
Strengthened procedures
Responding to the report, the Medical Research Council (MRC) said: ""Despite the use of peer review to assess whether projects we fund are worth doing, it is inevitable that some of it does not work out.""
The MRC added that it would continue to work to ensure all grants using non-human primates made clear the expected scientific, medical or social benefit, and that if these benefits were not realised, the reasons why should be explored to ensure lessons were learnt for the future.
In a joint statement, the main funders of monkey research in the UK - the Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust and the Biological and Biotechnology Research Council - said improvements to procedures had already been made.
""We have strengthened our procedures for assessing all grant applications requesting use of [monkeys], cats, dogs and equines,"" their statement read.
""These applications are now reviewed by the independent National Centre for the Refinement, Reduction and Replacement of Animals in Research (NC3Rs).
""Any concerns are explored with the applicants, and funding is not awarded unless these are properly addressed. We will continue to work with the NC3Rs to ensure that all research we fund using NHPs is assessed appropriately and the research undertaken is of the highest standard in terms of science and animal welfare.""
The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection said primate research was a blind alley that had no merit.
Chief Executive Michelle Thew said: ""This report is a chilling insight into primate research in the UK. Regulations to protect primates are failing.
""It is shocking that 25 years after legislation was introduced to give primates special protection, many experiments are being carried out that have a devastating impact on them with little or no human benefit. The only measure that would completely protect primates, and ensure more productive medical research, is an outright ban.""
In general, the number of animal experiments carried out in the UK rose by 3% last year, according to government figures.
Just over 3.7 million scientific experiments on animals were started in Great Britain in 2010, an increase of 105,000 on the previous year.",A review of the use of monkeys in UK medical research says the practice should continue and finds the current work to be generally of good quality.

Councillor Robin Wood said the venue could have been kept ""alive"" in the interim until a bidder was found.
He said: ""For over a year now we have been wondering what on earth is going to happen. Now we are told the wrecking ball is going to go at it.
""I think it would be much better to refurbish it and reopen it and look at other alternatives. What we will end up with is a pile of rubble and nothing.""
Dave Parry, of the Derby Civic Society, said the venue was too big for the market place and never really achieved what it set out to do.
""We would like to see something that would be representative of the city,"" he said.
""I'm not sure that it is the right place for a cultural thing, but we also don't want to see a supermarket or block of flats there.""",The curtain is set to fall on a music venue in Derby where a host of famous acts have thrilled fans for decades.

35744255,"The lead investigator was seeking to clarify earlier comments by police that suggested some of the driver's actions were deliberate.
Band members Kris Leonard, River Reeves, Jack Dakin and Tomas Lowe died, along with manager Craig Tarry, 33, near Stockholm on 13 February.
Lars Berglund said the driver's ""only intention was to avoid a crash"".
Witnesses reported seeing the car going though red lights and barriers before the Warrington band's car plunged 80ft (24m) into a canal off a bridge, the middle section of which was raised.
Mr Berglund told Mirror reporter Rhian Lubin: ""I have not suggested that [the driver] was doing this in order to kill himself or the band. I said he was making a move from the right lane to the left lane and that was not accidental.
""We can see the brake lights. His intention was to stop the car. But maybe his speed was too high and it was too late.""
Earlier, a Stockholm police spokesman said: ""It looks like he [the driver] tried to drive past red lights, barriers.
""All the witnesses thought it looked like he was trying to drive past... there weren't supposed to be cars on the left.
'It is a possibility he deliberately crashed the car, but he may have misunderstood the signs.
""[It is] still subject to investigation and we are still waiting for results of technical investigation too.""
Police have previously confirmed the driver, who has not been identified, had no traces of alcohol or drugs and said it would have been very difficult to pass two lines of parked cars if he was asleep.
The car, carrying the four members of the band and their manager, was recovered from the canal under the E4 highway bridge in Sodertalje, Sweden.
In the week after the accident, the band reached number one in the iTunes chart following a social media campaign backed by Oasis singer Liam Gallagher and Tim Burgess from The Charlatans.
A concert in the band's memory at Warrington's Parr Hall on 2 April has now sold out.
The gig, which will feature friends and bands they have played with, will be hosted in their Warrington hometown by BBC Radio 1 DJ Phil Taggart.","Swedish police say they do not believe the Viola Beach crash driver ""intended to kill himself or the band""."
37725081,"The BCCI, which governs the game in India, has agreed to trial the technology against Alastair Cook's side in the five-match Test series which begins in Rajkot on 9 November.
Whatever you think of DRS, which uses different types of technology to determine if a batsman should be given out, it's very good that it's now being standardised.
Everybody should play with it or nobody plays with it. At least now it brings everybody into line to play cricket together under the same regulations.
However, on pitches which are bound to suit the spinners - an area where India excel - and wear appreciably over the five days of a Test, I imagine the decision will help the Indians immensely.
Playing spinners with DRS in place is an altogether different and more challenging prospect than without it and it will make India more difficult to beat for England.
That's not the main point though: it's good India have joined in with what everyone else has been doing for a few years.
India v England tour schedule
That's an interesting question and many of the answers lie in the fact there has been a changing of the guard at the top of Indian cricket recently.
That has brought about a much more open mind to these things. Their head coach Anil Kumble, who was opposed to the DRS system to begin with, has now changed his view.
With a number of new players coming into the side, he's been able to show that it might possibly be the right thing for his side.
Beforehand, batsmen like Sachin Tendulkar, for instance, were opposed to it.
They felt the opposition would always keep a review up their sleeve especially for them because they were such key players.
Ultimately, however, it's as simple as a change of attitude within the administration of the Indian cricket team which has led to this decision.
Once we get onto the pitch, I think India, under their innovative new captain Virat Kohli, will use it well.
Spin bowlers tend to have more success on the turning pitches of the subcontinent, and India have the world's number one bowler - off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin - in their ranks.
England's batsmen must be careful how they play the spinning ball. For instance, you can't just plant your pad and play around the ball because of the risk of getting out lbw.
We've seen in the current Test match in Chittagong how central the DRS system is to games on the subcontinent.
Moeen Ali overturned three lbw decisions to remain at the crease and score a determined 68.
Those decisions were reversed because the ball was shown to be missing the stumps, but if it comes down to fine margins and the umpire has already given a batsman out then it will stay that way.
That's the challenge for England, and one which they are dealing with in Bangladesh at the moment.

34649263,"Ednane Mahmood, 19, from Blackburn, Lancashire, then fled his home to allegedly travel to Syria to fight for so-called Islamic State (IS).
The video showed the beheading of David Haines and aid worker Alan Henning kneeling on the ground after his kidnap, Manchester Crown Court heard.
Mr Mahmood denies all charges.
He has pleaded not guilty to attempting to travel to Syria to commit acts of terrorism.
Mr Mahmood also denies two counts of providing internet links to others with speeches and propaganda that encouraged acts of terrorism.
He searched ""British man beheaded"" on his laptop before downloading the video, the court was told.
It began with Prime Minister David Cameron talking about IS before images showing the beheading of Mr Haines.
Julian Evans, prosecuting, said Mr Mahmood, ""undeterred by this graphic and violent imagery"", began looking up cheap flights to Bulgaria and Turkey.
Then in the early hours of 18 September 2014, he left his home to board a flight from Manchester Airport to Bulgaria leaving a letter addressed, ""to family"", stating his intentions.
Mr Evans said: ""He was telling his family in the clearest terms that he was leaving the comforts of his life in the UK in order to fight abroad on behalf of Allah and on behalf of Muslims.
""He did not care what others might think of him and his decision.
""Mr Mahmood planned to travel to Syria with the intention of committing acts of terrorism.""
The court heard his family had been unaware of his intentions and on the day he fled had reported him missing to police.
Before he reached Syria, Mr Mahmood's brother persuaded him to come back to the UK via communications over Twitter.
Mr Mahmood's interest in Syria, Jihad and IS was said to have developed over time from 2012, the court heard.

Their spending, including at Bicester Village outlet, has also increased from almost Â£8m to more than Â£20m, according to Visit Britain.
A further rise has been predicted for the next ten years.
Martin Walker, from not-for-profit group Experience Oxfordshire, said Chinese tourists were ""increasingly important"" to the county's economy.
However, he said, the UK was currently ""underperforming"" with about 290,000 visitors a year, compared to countries such as France, which gets 350,000.
A number of attractions and travel organisations in Oxfordshire had signed up to the Great China Welcome initiative in a bid to encourage more visitors, he said.
In 2013, consultancy company Spectrum Insights found Chinese tourists spend 90% of their budget on shopping during UK visits.
It said Bicester Village was the most popular shopping destination in the UK, with 27% of Chinese visitors naming it as their favourite.
Keith Slater, a former director of several UK retailers, said bosses had ""deliberately set out to market to the Chinese and to promote it as a must-go place.""
""It's actually marketed as Bicester Village London, so is seen as part of the capital,"" he said.

As well as working at Folville Rise Junior School in Leicester, Farrands was a scoutmaster and lay preacher.
The four victims were aged between six and 12 when Farrands abused them.
Sentencing Farrands, Judge Nicholas Dean QC said: ""This was a breach of trust as a school teacher and a scoutmaster and the effect continues to haunt the victims.
""The sentence must seem lenient to the victims but they should look at the total sentence.""
He pleaded guilty to seven additional charges of indecent assault against boys between 1976 and 1981.
Leicestershire Police said Farrands committed most of his crimes at Folville Rise Junior School.
Det Sgt Hazel Sandall hopes the case will encourage other victims of historical abuse to come forward.
She said: ""No matter how old the offender and no matter how many years ago crimes took place, we will conduct a thorough examination of the evidence and will not hesitate to seek charges being brought against perpetrators of crime where evidence is available to us.""
Two of the victims came to Leicester Crown Court, where Farrands appeared via video link, to see him sentenced.
The court heard one victim contacted the NSPCC in 2014 and said he had been abused by Farrands and two other people, who he believed have since died.
Some of the boys were assaulted multiple times.

The Springboks ran in eight second-half tries in all to earn a bonus-point win at the Olympic Stadium.
South Africa top Pool B and will now play the loser of Saturday's Pool A decider between Australia and Wales.
A mixture of South Africa's ill-discipline and poor finishing kept the score down in the first half, while USA only made it into the Boks' 22 in the last minute of the half, despite enjoying plenty of possession.
Centre Damien de Allende scored his first international try before South Africa were awarded a penalty try as USA struggled at the scrum.
A different South Africa came out after the break as Habana scored almost from the restart, collecting a Fourie du Preez kick to go over in the corner.
Bismarck du Plessis and Francois Louw both crossed the line, before Habana scored two tries in two minutes to complete his hat-trick.
Louw scored his second with Jesse Kriel also getting on the scoresheet, before Lwazi Mvovo rounded off a dominant Springboks performance.
Habana had a subdued first half, with his only contribution of note seeing him clatter into Blaine Scully as the pair competed for a high ball.
But he came out firing in the second half and his hat-trick not only saw him equal New Zealand legend Lomu as the tournament's all-time leading try scorer, but also draw level with Australia's David Campese for joint second in the list of Test try scorers with 64.
The 32-year-old, a 2007 World Cup-winner with the Boks, scored 62 seconds into the second half for his 13th World Cup try.
He then went over unopposed in the 59th minute after a break by De Allende and swooped on a loose ball to dive over in the corner just two minutes later.
Habana could have broken All Black winger Lomu's record but a knock-on as he tried to collect another chip through denied him a fourth try on the night.
South Africa's World Cup campaign started in the worst possible way with that shock loss to Japan, but they recovered with a bonus point victory over Samoa and a comfortable win against Scotland.
If they are to win the tournament, they will be the first side to do so having lost a pool match.
Before the USA game, Boks coach Heyneke Meyer talked about his side ""doing a Roger Bannister"", citing the British runner who broke the four-minute mile barrier as an example of overcoming the impossible.
He also spoke about respecting their opponents but in the first half they showed signs of complacency and failed to pile the points on an under-strength USA, who had made 12 changes from their defeat by Scotland.
A rejuvenated and more clinical Springboks came out after the break - and eight tries in 40 minutes will certainly send out a message to the teams left in the competition.

39659166,"Vicki Russell told the CBC that Air Canada bumped her from the 1 April Toronto-to-Miami flight that she had booked two months in advance.
As a result she missed her connecting flight to meet the cruise ship.
Ms Russell has since received C$800 (US$592; Â£463) compensation from the airline.
She says everything went according to plan until an agent told her about two hours after she had checked in and received her boarding pass that the flight was overbooked and she did not have a valid ticket.
Despite showing her travel documents and getting the tour company to email her trip receipt to prove her ticket was valid, the flight left without her.
""It was extremely upsetting,"" Ms Russell told the CBC. ""The woman could not have been more rude, hostile. In all my years of travelling, I have never had a travel person treat me so badly.""
She was sent to Air Canada customer service at the airport to find a new flight to Miami. By the time she was seen by an agent, no flights were available that would allow her to make the connection. She also had to wait to get back her checked luggage.
She filed a complaint for missing her ""dream vacation"" with Air Canada the next day.
The $10,000 National Geographic cruise, organised by Lindblad Expeditions, tours the famous Pacific Ocean archipelago's varied islands and habitats.
A spokeswoman for Lindblad Expeditions said on Friday they have been in contact with Ms Russell throughout the situation and have rebooked her expedition at no charge, including airfare from Miami to Galapagos.
Air Canada confirmed that the flight had been oversold.
But the carrier said their agents spent ""a great deal of time"" looking at options for Ms Russell, including exploring ""outside the box"" solutions for getting her directly to the Galapagos Islands despite her flight ticket being issued only to Miami. They noted they refunded her initial fare and paid compensation.
""This is a very regrettable situation and we are sorry this occurred,"" said an Air Canada spokesman in a statement.
The practice of airlines bumping passengers from flights has been under scrutiny since the footage of United Airlines passenger David Dao being forcibly removed from a flight made headlines worldwide.
Following that incident, Canada's federal government reiterated its pledge to table a passenger rights law this spring.
It is expected to include compensation rules for those denied boarding due to factors within the carrier's control.

38082943,"There was no secret that the picture today's Autumn Statement would paint would not be pretty. But more than £100bn of extra borrowing, roughly equivalent to the entire NHS budget - nearly £60bn of that the costs of Brexit - make a brutal backdrop for Theresa May's government as it only just gets going.
Remember all the figures ought to be taken with a giant pinch of salt. Forecasts like these have so often been wrong. And no one is forecasting a recession.
But what the chancellor said today and the Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated have big implications.
First off, with the goal of balancing the books now an aspiration to be met as ""early as possible"", next Parliament, the Tories will be going into the next election, a decade after they took charge, without having kept the central promise they made 10 years before of clearing the deficit.
Yes, you read that right - a full decade. As political promises go, that is a less than glorious record.
Voters will see the national debt hitting 90% of GDP, not shy of £2 trillion, 10 years after being told that tough spending cuts were worth it, because within five years we would be on our way back to the mythic sunlit uplands.
There is a separate debate about whether that was ever achievable, and how much Brexit can be blamed for the fact Mr Hammond has pushed those targets back again.  But at the very least, it means the Conservatives will still be borrowing, and borrowing significantly, busting their own timetable by at least five years.
And with wages predicted to slow, and inflation expected to rise, the public will feel the pinch too. Simply, if today's forecasts are right, the government's finances are set to be shaky for a lot longer, and more voters will feel skint.
Despite Theresa May's repeated desire to help families who are finding it hard to make ends meet, there were few measures that will make a big difference.
Privately, Treasury sources acknowledge they haven't done that much, despite Number 10's hopes. The truth is that they didn't have much cash to play with.
And Mr Hammond's ambitions to rebuild the fundamentals of the economy were clearly his priority, rather than major concessions to help some groups of voters feel a bit more flush.
Indeed, the charts that estimate who is bearing the brunt of the government's policies suggest that when everything is taken into consideration, not just today's measures, the three poorest groups are all slightly worse off. The only group that loses more is the top 10%.
Beyond all the charts and tables and documents, though, Mr Hammond dropped one giant hint which is perhaps politically one of the most important things of the day.
He was talking about the ""triple lock"", the guaranteed increases in the state pension, seen by many in Westminster privately to be completely unaffordable in the longer term, but few will yet say it in public.
He said: ""And we will meet our pledge to our country's pensioners through the triple lock. But as we look ahead to the next Parliament, we will need to ensure we tackle the challenges of rising longevity and fiscal sustainability.
""And so the government will review public spending priorities and other commitments for the next Parliament in light of the evolving fiscal position at the next Spending Review.""
That sounds pretty bland, but the implications are anything but. It holds out the possibility that the Tories could look at ditching those guarantees and ""other commitments"", perhaps the ring fence of the NHS Budget, when they look at what the country can afford after 2020.
It was only a hint, but in time it may become a very important one. Mr Hammond rarely says anything by mistake.
But, without fighting that political battle, there was plenty that was bruising enough from today's announcements, plenty to make the government's life harder, and indeed, potentially those of plenty of voters too.
PS As ever, the documents published alongside the statement bear close examination. In the coming days more important nuggets may emerge.
But a few quick ones that caught our eye -  the administration of Brexit is expected to cost the taxpayer £412m. The government has set aside £60m a year for grammar schools to expand.",Ouch!

At least 24 cadets were reported to have been left unconscious because pillows were stuffed with hard objects.

He was quoted in the New York Times as saying that those facing such measures included ""senior military members and cadets alike"".
Gen Caslen was not reported to have identified or provided the ranks of those who may be punished, but said he was determined ""to send a clear message that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated"".
An army investigation dated the pillow fights to 2001, but congressional testimony reported in the New York Times suggests they date back more than a century.
One cadet suffered a broken nose in the August pillow fight, while others had dislocated shoulders.

The annual night-time event has been described as a harmless way of blowing off steam at the end of a gruelling summer of training.
But this year's event seems to have been a little over-exuberant, with pillow cases reported to have been stuffed with hard objects, thought to have been helmets.

Forsyth and his partner Moira Wylie gifted the work made in 1991 by Campbell, who died at the age of 54 in 2007.
It will hang in the art school's library.
Gregory's Girl director Forsyth first met Campbell in the 1980s. The two were fishing buddies.
When Campbell was asked to paint a famous Scot for the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, he chose Forsyth, as the only famous person he knew, and a friend.
Fake Ophelia is formed of paint, textiles, string, wallpaper and paper cut work.
Campbell went to the GSA as a mature student, graduating in 1982 with a Fulbright Scholarship which he used to travel to New York.
He returned to live in Glasgow in 1986 and emerged in the group of Scottish figurative painters which also consisted of fellow GSA alumni Ken Currie, Peter Howson and Adrian Wiszniewski.
Alison Stevenson, head of learning resources at the GSA, said: ""We are grateful to Bill and Moira for this generous donation to the GSA's archives and collections.

However, the force claimed it was justified in secretly monitoring the phones of two former officers.
Mark Dias and Steve Matthews claim they were targeted after challenging misconduct by fellow officers.
The decision over whether the force's covert techniques used against its former employees were lawful will be made in the new year, following an Investigatory Powers Tribunal.
At the hearing in London, Judge Sir Michael Burton said although he reserved judgement until 2017, it was clear what his decision would be.

Fair Work Australia, the national industrial tribunal, adjourned a hearing on the Qantas dispute on Saturday night. The tribunal - which has the power to suspend or terminate industrial action - is to reconvene later on Sunday.
Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has warned that the dispute could have ""implications"" for the national economy.
The airline has been hit by a series of costly strikes. Baggage handlers, engineers and pilots have been involved in the action which the company says is costing A$15m (US$16m) a week.
The airline issued a statement on its Facebook page saying customers booked on Qantas flights should not go to the airport until further notice. The airline said a full refund would be available to those affected.
Relations between the unions and Qantas management started deteriorating in August after the airline announced plans for restructuring and moving some operations to Asia.
By Phil MercerBBC News, Sydney
At the heart of the dispute are concerns about pay and job security along with cost-cutting and the subcontracting of work overseas as Qantas looks to set up new airlines in Asia and sack hundreds of staff to revive its sagging international fortunes.
At Sydney international airport, feelings among marooned passengers oscillated between anger and frustration.
Qantas' decision to pull its entire international and domestic fleets from the skies comes during one of Australia's busiest travel weekends, with tens thousands of people converging on the hugely popular Melbourne Cup horse race, an event that stops the nation for a few, brief minutes.

Qantas grounded: Your stories
Qantas has a 65% share of the domestic Australian market, but has been making heavy losses on its international flights.
The restructuring is expected to mean the loss of 1,000 jobs from its 35,000-strong workforce.
The disruption to flights has also affected a meeting of Commonwealth heads of government in Perth, with reports that members from 17 delegations have been stranded in the city because of the dispute. It comes on a busy travel weekend, just days before the country's biggest horse race, the Melbourne Cup.
The Australian minister for transport, Anthony Albanese, said the government would take action to intervene in the dispute.
""We are very concerned about Qantas' actions, of which we were notified only mid-afternoon, with no advance notice from Qantas at any stage,"" he said.

""The government is making an urgent application to Fair Work Australia to terminate all industrial action at Qantas. This will be aimed at both actions by unions and by Qantas management.""
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce announced the grounding of the airline on Saturday: ""The airline will be grounded as long as it takes to reach a conclusion on this.""
He said that he would not take ""the easy way out"" and agree to union demands. ""That would destroy Qantas in the long term.""
""I'm actually taking the bold decision, an unbelievable decision, a very hard decision, to ground this airline.""
Mr Joyce said he made the decision early Saturday and then gained the approval of the Qantas board.
""We are locking out until the unions withdraw their extreme claim and reach an agreement with us,"" Mr Joyce said. ""This is the fastest way to ensure the airline gets back in the air.""
""They are trashing our strategy and our brand,"" he said.
""They must decide just how badly they want to hurt Qantas, their members... and the travelling public.""
The Australian pilots association criticised the grounding.
""It's unprecedented and really it has hijacked the nation. It really has put everyone on notice and... it's forcing the government's hand on this,"" Barry Jackson of the Australian and International Pilots Association told Sky News.
""We really need to address this sooner rather than later and get the aircraft back in the air.""

40936964,"Charlie Alliston, of Trothy Road, Bermondsey, was 18 when he allegedly hit Kim Briggs as she crossed Old Street, east London, in February 2016.
The Old Bailey heard a witness saw the cyclist fly ""through the air"".
Mr Alliston, now 20, denies manslaughter and causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving.
In court, prosecutor Duncan Penny QC read a statement from eyewitness David Callan who said he was walking in Old Street at about 12:15 BST when he heard a male voice calling.
""It made me look up immediately, just in time to see a collision between a cyclist and a pedestrian,"" he said.
Mr Callan said the crash caused the cyclist to fly ""through the air"" while the pedestrian ""fell at the point of impact"".
""The cyclist clattered to the ground further down the road but quickly sprang to their feet and shouted something at the pedestrian... who lay on the ground,"" the court was told.
Mark Wyeth QC, defending, suggested his client had the right of way as the lights on the stretch of Old Street were green.
He added that Mrs Briggs could have avoided danger by using a pedestrian crossing less than 10 metres away.
Jurors heard the 44-year-old HR consultant suffered ""non-survivable brain injuries"" and died in hospital a week later.
They were previously told Mr Alliston was using a bike which which had no front brake so was not legal to use on the road.
The court has been told crash investigators had concluded Mr Alliston would have been able to stop and avoid the impact if the bike had been fitted with two brakes.
The trial continues.","A cyclist accused of killing a woman by ploughing into her in a London street began shouting at her as she lay injured, a court has heard."

There were also several cases of posting personal data on websites, and an e-mail which accidentally disclosed sensitive details of 24 dead people.
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) called for effective data handling to become second nature.
Seven of the 22 local authorities said they had recorded no breaches last year.
BBC Wales' Welsh-language news website Newyddion Ar-lein obtained the information in a Freedom of Information request.
The ICO was informed about ""several incidents"" in Anglesey council in 2012 in which documents including personal data ""were either disclosed or disposed of inappropriately, or there was a risk of unauthorised access"".
After an investigation, the ICO  said that the council's guidelines on data protection were insufficient and the chief executive committed to making improvements.
An Anglesey council spokesperson said: ""In order to secure improvements, we have recently established a corporate information governance project board to embed and improve a culture of data protection compliance throughout the whole organisation.""
The 17 breaches in Powys council included five internal cases of misdirecting information, and 12 cases of sending information to the wrong address, recording wrong personal data in correspondence, and placing personal data on the council's website. Disciplinary procedures were taken against one staff member.
There were seven cases recorded in Cardiff council. Among them were a member of staff accidentally sending an email to a number of third party individuals - including Cardiff council employees, Vale of Glamorgan council and individuals in the NHS - which accidentally disclosed sensitive details of 24 dead people. However, the Data Protection Act does not apply to the deceased.
Also in Cardiff council, a worker sent an e-mail with sensitive personal data to the wrong person internally and a planning file containing personal data was lost.
There were seven cases in Wrexham Council. On two occasions the social services department mistakenly shared information with a third party; e-mail addresses of subscribers to the housing department portal were shared by mistake, and the council failed to respond to a request for data within the necessary 40 days four times.
Four cases were recorded in Flintshire council. Disciplinary action was taken against one worker who allowed a partner to access and amend personal data.
In addition, two committee reports which included personal data were mistakenly published on the website, a letter about children's services was sent to the wrong house, and a CD with personal data was lost.
Five cases were reported in Newport council, and two workers were given final written warnings.
Gwynedd council said that none of the data involved in its five breaches was sensitive, while in Caerphilly council further training was provided after three cases in which personal data was mistakenly revealed.
In Conwy ""several cases"" were recorded of missing data, involving e-mails, faxes and letters being misdirected, and information being stolen from vehicles and property.
There were two breaches in Carmarthenshire council. A private company was used to send a circular to each member of the Dyfed Pension Fund. It  printed members' national insurance number on each envelope, and accepted full responsibility for the mistake. In addition, the council failed to respond to a request for information within the 40 statutory days.
There was one breach in Pembrokeshire council in 2012 when information regarding planning enforcement was published in error on its website, while Bridgend council also recorded one breach when a mobile phone which had personal data about service users was lost for some hours.
The single breach in Ceredigion council occurred when a letter to an employee was sent to the wrong address, and also one breach in Denbighshire council involving personal information being sent to the wrong person.
In Neath Port Talbot council, a breach occurred when referral forms involving three prospective service users were stolen from a service provider commissioned by the council.
There were no breaches in 2012 in Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Torfaen, Swansea and the Vale of Glamorgan.
The Information Commissioner's Office said: ""It's vital that local authorities properly live up to their legal responsibility to keep personal data secure, particularly where it is sensitive information about children and young people.
""Our concern isn't just that councils have the right policies and procedures in place; it's about bringing about a culture among staff whereby everyone takes their responsibilities seriously and effective data handling becomes second nature.""","Local authorities in Wales broke data protection laws over 60 times in 2012, BBC Wales has learned."

Terry met Chelsea fan Tommi last year, and when he was told of the boy's death he volunteered to pay for the service.
Tommi was laid to rest near his Cambridge home in a Chelsea-blue casket bearing the club logo.
Tommi, who was diagnosed with leukaemia aged three, died last month after a bone marrow transplant proved unsuccessful.
More on this and other stories from Cambridgeshire
Family friend Tawney Bianca Toogood contacted Terry on Instagram to tell him the boy he had been photographed with had died.
When she explained the family could not afford the funeral they wanted for their son, the former England captain got in touch with the funeral parlour and covered the full Â£1,600 costs.
Tommi's mother Ruth said she was ""overwhelmed"" by the gesture and ""very proud"" the footballer - one of her son's favourite players - remembered him.
Most of the arrangements for Tommi's funeral were made by Mrs Toogood's mother Mally Beaver, and sister Chelsea.
The families became friends after meeting on the cancer ward at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
""My father battled leukaemia for just 12 weeks, but Tommi fought it for five years,"" Mrs Beaver said.
""His family found times tough and we did everything we could to help them out.""
When Tommi died the Beaver family, from the travelling community, reached out to other travellers for help.
""Roo and Kevin [Tommi's father] aren't from the community, but everyone took them to their hearts,"" Mrs Beaver said.

27464444,"Hibs' 15-year stay in the Scottish Premiership was in danger after Jason Scotland's goal reduced their 2-0 first-leg lead in the play-off final.
Anthony Andreu squared the tie 10 seconds from the end of stoppage time.
Neither side managed to score in extra time, but Hibs' Kevin Thomson and Jason Cummings both had penalties saved.
It was goals from teenager Cummings that had given Terry Butcher's side a 2-0 advantage over the Championship runners-up after the first leg at New Douglas Park.
But it was Accies goalkeeper Kevin Cuthbert who was the hero of the return leg, parrying away two nervously struck spot kicks to spark scenes of joy among the Accies faithful and protests outside Easter Road from their angry home counterparts.
The spirits of the majority of the 18,000 near-capacity crowd had already not only been dampened by a dreich Edinburgh downpour but the kind of abject display all to familiar from the men in green and white this season.
And four perfect penalties from Hamilton will send shockwaves through Easter Road after a season that started with a 9-0 aggregate defeat by Malmo under one manager and ended with a run of one win in 15 games and relegation under another.
They are now facing the prospect of chasing one automatic promotion spot in a Championship that will not only contain relegated neighbours Hearts but League One champions Rangers, two clubs recovering from their respective financial meltdowns.
Few had given Accies, who had already come through a two-leg semi-final against Falkirk, much chance of rescuing their promotion hopes as they arrived in Edinburgh looking for a first win in four away games.
However, the statistics also gave them hope - having only lost two of their last 16 games, while Hibs had not won any of their last six at home and their midweek win being their first in 14 outings.
Butcher had given on-loan Notts County forward Danny Haynes another chance to show why he was capped for England at youth level by starting the 26-year-old ahead of off-form teenager Alex Harris.
After a crunching Jon Routledge tackle had the former Ipswich man limping for the touchline after seven minutes, Hibs were back to their midweek line-up.
Six minutes on and Haynes' pain spread to the home stands after a misplaced Ryan McGivern pass led to the ball being swiftly dispatched into the back of the Hibs net.
An interception by Accies midfielder Ali Crawford, who had started ahead of James Keatings, was flicked on by Routledge and Scotland's quick turn mugged Michael Nelson before the striker's left-foot drive from just inside the penalty box slipped under the outstretched hand of goalkeeper Ben Williams.
The veteran former Trinidad and Tobago international had not been considered match fit at New Douglas Park, but his introduction in place of Mikael Antoine-Curier had provided the missing goalscoring link.
As with the first leg, it was Accies who were playing the prettier possession football while Hibs were relying on hopeful balls to expose flaws in a second-tier defence.
The ploy, either by accident or design, almost worked for the home side as Paul Heffernan's joy at finding the net was cut short by an offside flag then the striker broke clear before firing across goal.
If Williams had been at fault for the goal, he made up with it as his outstretched foot prevented Louis Longridge's low drive tying the aggregate score.
Cummings had a close-range header cleared off the Accies goal-line, but Hibs were fortunate not to find themselves further behind on the day by half-time as Andreu fired into the side-netting.
Butcher threw Cummings up front in support of Heffernan after the break in search of a tension-releasing equaliser, but the reduction in midfield manpower was leaving their creaking defence exposed.
When Scotland cleverly chested down a cross at the back post and another twist left two Hibs men flying in the opposite direction, Williams had to be quick off his line to block the striker's shot.
Accies, with manager Alex Neil having brought himself into midfield from the bench, continued to play the tidier football but the chances dried up and Hibs went into four minutes of injury time with an aggregate lead.
But there was to be a dramatic equaliser with Scotland shrugging off Michael Nelson to cross low for the stretching Andreu to fire home from 10 yards.
And the visitors' joy turned to ecstasy 30 minutes later as Scotland's capital city was left without a representative in the nation's top flight.

Sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles jumped 19.9% year-on-year, with diesels up 5.6%.
Fleet sales fell 1.4% but still accounted for 53.1% of new vehicle sales in the month.
SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""February is typically one of the quietest months of the year ahead of March's plate change, but this positive performance is encouraging and puts the sector in a good position for the coming 12 months.""
Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said only 4% of cars typically were registered in February, so ""small movements in the absolute number of registrations have a big impact on the headline growth number"".
""High consumer confidence, lower petrol prices and cheaper unsecured credit have enhanced the attractiveness of car ownership, but these drivers will be less supportive of sales growth in 2016,"" he added.
""Growth in car sales therefore looks likely to moderate, contributing to a slowdown in the overall consumer spending recovery this year.""
A record 2.63 million new vehicles were registered last year - about 6% higher than in 2014 and the fourth consecutive year of growth, according to the SMMT.
The top selling models in February were the Ford Fiesta, Volkswagen Golf and Nissan Qashqai.
VW sales were down 13% compared with February 2015, although Toyota recorded a 16% drop and Vauxhall a 17% slide.

38770216,"Now it's been announced that Bryan Cranston is to make his UK stage debut in an adaptation of the 1970s Oscar-winning film Network.
The 60-year-old US actor will play Howard Beale, a TV news anchor who announces he will kill himself on air after he's told he's being sacked for declining ratings.
In a famous scene, Beale implores his viewers during an on-air meltdown to shout out of the window: ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more!""
Adapted by Billy Elliot writer Lee Hall, Network will open on the National Theatre's Lyttelton stage in November.
It will be directed by Ivo van Hove, whose Hedda Gabler at the NT is currently a sell-out hit.
Announcing its new season on Friday, National Theatre boss Rufus Norris described Network as ""one of the greatest media satires of all time"".
""It's incredibly prescient in terms of the world today,"" he said. ""I think it will stand up in our digital world.""
The 1976 film, directed by Sidney Lumet, won four of its 10 Oscar nominations.
Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway and Beatrice Straight cleaned up in three of the four acting categories while writer Paddy Chayefsky won for original screenplay.
Norris said van Hove had been talking about the idea with Cranston for ""a couple of years"".
""He's got a fantastic pedigree as a stage actor,"" he said. ""It's a part that requires something compelling and special.""
Norris pointed out that Beale's ""mad as hell"" line was still being quoted at demonstrations - and had appeared on a placard held by singer Charlotte Church at a rally in 2015.
Cranston won a Tony award in 2014 for his Broadway debut in Robert Schenkkan's play All the Way. He was Oscar nominated last year for Trumbo.

34257282,"He has launched a consultation to try to find agreement on how universities should be paid for.
The consultation has been called the 'Big Conversation'.
Speaking in the assembly, Mr Farry said that Northern Ireland was the only part of the UK actively ""disinvesting"" in higher education.
The consultation process will involve a number of events and online presentations in order to seek opinion from students, university staff, unions and the wider public.
Just under 40% of funding for Queen's University, Belfast (QUB) and Ulster University comes directly from Stormont's Department for Employment and Learning (DEL).
However, the universities faced cuts of more than £16m in funding from DEL in 2015/16, which followed cuts in funding during previous years.
Ulster University is shedding about 200 jobs in 2015/16 and 1,200 student places over the next three years, while Queen's University announced in April that it was cutting 236 jobs in 2015/16 and 1,010 student places over the next three years.
Ulster University also closed a number of courses and departments including their School of Modern Languages at Coleraine, County Londonderry.
The universities also draw about 30% of their annual funding from student tuition fees, which are currently £3,805 per year for students from Northern Ireland.
Some students also study for degrees at further education colleges, and that budget was also reduced this year by about £12m.
DEL's budget was reduced by £62m earlier this year, and its budget for higher education institutions fell from £203m to £186m, a reduction of 8.2%.
Mr Farry said that, given its importance to the local economy and the fact that just under half of young people in Northern Ireland entered higher education, the status quo was no longer an option.
During subsequent questions, a number of MLAs including Phil Flanagan of Sinn Féin, Jim Allister of the Tradition Unionist Voice (TUV) and Basil McCrea of NI21, expressed concern about a possible rise in tuition fees.
In response, Mr Farry said that he had an ""open mind"" and that ""this is not a conversation about whether we have fees or don't have fees"".
""All options have to be on the table and fees are only one of many options facing us. This is not a done deal process.""
The consultation ends on 23 October, and Mr Farry said he wanted to present options to the Northern Ireland Executive in the autumn.","The way that higher education is funded in Northern Ireland is ""no longer sustainable"", Employment and Learning Minister Stephen Farry has said."

Mr McGuigan was shot at Comber Court in east Belfast on Wednesday night.
Asked if he was concerned about IRA involvement, Mr Robinson said: ""I think everyone should be concerned that would be the case.""
""Let's allow the police to fully investigate the matter,"" he said.
""We will speak to the PSNI to see what their findings are in terms of the involvement of any organisation.
""But let's be very clear, there will be repercussions if that was found to be the case.""
He added: ""It would certainly be totally unacceptable for any organisation which is involved in violence to be part of the Executive of Northern Ireland.""
Mr Robinson was referring to the potential political consequences for Sinn FÃ©in, the main republican party in Northern Ireland and the second biggest party in the assembly.
Mr Robinson described the murder as a ""savage killing"" and said it ""should be a warning to all politicians and others about how easy it would be to slip back into those bad old days.""
He said there were people who would step into a ""void"" to ""exploit political difficulties"".
""The collapse of the assembly will feed that kind of activity we have seen over the last number of weeks from dissidents in our society,"" the DUP leader added.
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Alex Maskey said he did not believe the PIRA was involved in the murder and expressed concern about ""unhelpful speculation"".
""I don't accept for one second that the IRA has been involved in this, it just doesn't register at all,"" he said.
""We will be meeting the PSNI shortly to make sure that they do their job, which is to have a very thorough and rapid, speedy and professional investigation into whoever caused this killing and whoever caused this killing should be and hopefully will be brought to justice as speedily as at all possible.
""We're calling for calm, we're calling for respect for this particular family at this time in the midst of their grief and we're cautioning against unhelpful and unwelcome speculation.""
In a separate development, Mr Robinson said there had been talks over the summer between parties about the deadlock over welfare and that they would continue.
He said: ""We've gone through the exploratory stage.
""We're now at the preparatory stage where we look at what can be done in the circumstances. But clearly by the autumn it will be necessary to have reached an agreement.""
He said he did not want to be ""too precise"" over the date by which there had to be a resolution, but that the autumn was the critical time.
Mr Robinson added that progress was being made on all of the other issues in the Stormont House Agreement, including new mechanisms to deal with the past and the civil service voluntary exit scheme.
But he said the main issue holding up the process was welfare.
He warned again that the political institutions in Northern Ireland were in danger if the situation was not resolved.

35701607,"Two communities are claiming compensation and want Shell to clean up their land.
Shell said it is at an ""early stage"" in reviewing the claims and that the case should be heard in Nigeria.
The Ogale community of about 40,000 people in Rivers State, on the coast of Nigeria, who are mainly farmers or fishermen, are some of the claimants.
Their case is being handled by law firm Leigh Day.
Spills since 1989 have meant they don't have clean drinking water, farmland or rivers, their claim says.
It points to a November 2015 report by Amnesty International which says four spill sites Shell says it planned to clean up are still contaminated.
The first court hearing at the Technology and Construction Court, held on Wednesday, found that the claimants can can lodge a case against Shell's Nigerian business, known as Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC).  Shell declined to comment on the ruling.
Amnesty's findings followed a 2011 report by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which found water contaminated with oil by-products including benzene, thought to be a carcinogen. It suggested a clean up, but said a ""sustainable recovery"" of the area could take up to 30 years.
Shell says it has agreed a clean-up plan.
""In mid-2015 SPDC JV, along with the government, UNEP and representatives of the Ogoni community, agreed to an 18-month roadmap to fast-track the environmental clean-up and remediation of Ogoniland which includes a governance framework,"" it said in a statement.
The Bille community, who are mainly fishermen and are the other party to sue, claims Shell should be liable for ""failing to protect their pipelines from damage caused by third parties"", according to Leigh Day.
Pipelines in the area have been targets for thieves who steal crude oil and try to refine it locally. This has lead to more spills and damage though explosions.
""Both Bille and Ogale are areas heavily impacted by crude oil theft, pipeline sabotage and illegal refining which remain the main sources of pollution across the Niger Delta.
""Ogale is in Ogoniland and it is important to note that SPDC has produced no oil or gas in Ogoniland since 1993.  Access to the area has been limited following a rise in violence, threats to staff and attacks on facilities,"" Shell said.
But the communities say Shell pipelines lack the technology to detect and shut off leaks, whatever the cause.
Daniel Leader, partner at Leigh Day said: ""It is scandalous that four years after the UNEP Report Shell is yet to clean up its oil in either Ogale or Bille.   Our client's patience has now run out and we intend to force Shell to act since it is clear they have no intention of doing so on their own.""
In January last year, Shell agreed to an $84m (Â£55m) settlement with residents of the Bodo community in the Niger Delta for two oil spills.
The same law firm, Leigh Day, said their 15,600 clients would receive $3,300 each for losses caused by the spills.
The remaining $30m would be left for the community, which Leigh Day said was ""devastated by the two massive oil spills in 2008 and 2009"".
That dispute began in 2011.
During the trial emails, letters and internal reports submitted to a court in London, and seen by the BBC, showed that senior Shell employees were concerned before the spill that Shell's pipelines in the area had reached the end of their lives and needed replacing to avoid danger to lives, the environment and the economy.
Two spills in 2008 affected about 35 sq miles (90 sq km) in southern Nigeria, according to the Bodo community which sued Shell.
Shell said at the time it ""dismisses the suggestion that it has knowingly continued to use a pipeline that is not safe to operate"".",Oil giant Shell is being sued in London for the second time in five years over spills in the Niger Delta.

The Russian Olympic Committee subsequently revealed that 14 of those 31 athletes were Russian.
A Russian TV report then claimed those 14 athletes included 10 medallists, among them 33-year-old Chicherova, who is planning to defend her Olympic title at the Rio Games, which begin on 5 August.
Sports minister Vitaly Mutko admitted the news did not ""look good"" but said the results were ""not an objective picture"" of Russia's doping situation.

Russia's athletes are already banned from international competition following allegations of state-organised doping.
But in an interview with BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Mutko said he expected the ban to be lifted for Rio because it would be ""useless"" for the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to continue punishing them.
He also held the IAAF partly responsible for Russia's predicament, claiming it helped cover up the positive tests.
""The priority for them [IAAF] must be the development of track and field worldwide and you cannot achieve that with punishment,"" he said.
""It damages hugely the reputation and image of track and field. It would decrease the popularity of the sport in Russia. Kids would not want to do it.""",Olympic medallist Anna Chicherova has vowed to clear her name after learning she is one of 14 Russian athletes to have failed a doping retest.
39719314,"Seventeen student bodies have endorsed the BDS movement - which calls for an international boycott of Israel over the way it treats Palestinians.
Some Jewish students in the UK say growing support for BDS has fuelled a rise in anti-Semitism on campuses.
The Commission said it would assess the concerns and take action if necessary.
The BDS - which stands for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions - describes itself as a human rights organisation and criticises Israel for its human rights record.
It says it stands for ""freedom, justice and equality"", saying it is ""inclusive and categorically opposes as a matter of principle all forms of racism"" - including anti-Semitism.
Devora Khafi, a student at Queen Mary University of London, is one of nearly 10,000 Jewish students in the UK.
She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she felt physically intimidated when other students hijacked a speech at London's UCL given by a former Israeli defence force officer.
She said she was pushed against some doors, jostled and shouted at by protesters.
She says she fears having a connection with Israel has made other people at her university hostile towards her.
""If I ever express a viewpoint in class or on social media, I get comments, in public or private,"" she said.
""It has been hard. It's been two years of constant fighting for our freedom of speech, our rights, our wellbeing. I've missed deadlines, I've had counselling, I've had anxiety episodes,"" she said.
Devora believes the BDS movement is adding to a climate of hostility against Israel on campus, which she says has turned her and other Jewish students into scapegoats.
""If you look behind the BDS lens, it calls for these things that are not peaceful. They harm Jewish students and pro-Israel students and they don't support a peaceful, atmosphere on campus.""
Support for BDS has been growing rapidly on British campuses.
London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) students' union in London was one of the first to endorse the BDS, after students voted in favour in a referendum in 2015.
The students' union implemented an academic boycott of Israel.
The BBC found 17 students' unions have now passed motions to endorse the BDS boycott of Israel.
They include Belfast, Birkbeck, Brunel, Essex, Exeter, Goldsmiths, Kings College London, Kingston, Lancashire, Liverpool, Manchester, SOAS, Strathclyde, Sussex, Swansea, University of Arts London and UCL.
But it is possible they may be breaking the law by backing the movement.
Since 2010, students' unions have become registered charities, meaning they have a legal duty to represent the interests of their members.
According to guidance, public comment should also be limited to matters that affect the welfare of the union's members as students.
The BBC understands these issues have been raised with the Charity Commission, which is assessing them to determine if any regulatory action should be taken.
A Charity Commission spokesperson said concerns about links to the BDS Movement would be ""assessed consistently"" and, where appropriate, it would ""take regulatory action"".
David Holdsworth, from the commission, said students' unions must not be discriminatory towards students ""of a particular faith or race"".
Isaac Bentata, a student at UCL, said there were times when he didn't feel comfortable expressing his views as a Jewish student.
""During my first week at university all I saw were BDS stickers"", he explained.
He said he was accused of being a ""Mossad agent"" after speaking up at one BDS event.
""As we left the event we saw that we were being followed by this guy and we had to run to the station because we'd heard about him being particularly hostile,"" he added.
""I thought, 'this is not how I'm supposed to be feeling because I asked questions during a debate at a university'.""
Both the NUS and the BDS National Committee declined to comment to the BBC.
Of the students' unions we contacted, only SOAS provided us with a response.
Its co-president, Ayesha Abbasi, said it was a ""democratic organisation"" and followed ""democratic decision-making processes.""
""We have had no formal complaints of anti-Semitism or bullying from any Jewish students since the BDS referendum,"" she added.
Sai Englert, a Jewish PHD student at SOAS and a member of the university's Palestine Society, said: ""The idea that somehow supporting BDS, supporting boycott etc is a blanket boycott on individuals I think is very dangerous. It's not.
""It's about saying 'we don't want institutional links, economic links, political links with institutions, governments, companies that are complicit in attacks on rights'.""

39617174,"Resuming on 111-4, Voges moved his overnight score on from 29, occupying 196 deliveries to frustrate Hampshire's attack, led by Kyle Abbott (5-59).
As Voges, James Franklin and John Simpson fell to the new ball, it left them on 215-8 and Hampshire in hope of a win, with the lead at just 133.
But the Middlesex tail held on and hands were shaken on a draw after tea.
Middlesex were the only side to remain unbeaten over the entire 2016 season as they claimed their first title since 1993, but they looked in danger of beginning a new campaign with a loss when they got under way.
Without the injured Fidel Edwards, Abbott - who took his total to 16 Division One wickets in two matches - led Hampshire's attack, with Brad Wheal (3-73) also contributing.
Voges survived an lbw appeal on 29 before nightwatchman Steven Finn (16) was caught off a Wheal bouncer, but Simpson joined the former Australia Test batsman to stop any Hampshire momentum.
However, with the new ball in hand, Abbott gave the hosts a glimmer of hope, having Voges caught behind and Franklin taken in the slips before Gareth Berg snared Simpson (22) for wicket-keeper Lewis McManus' fourth catch.
It wasn't to be for Hampshire though as Toby Roland-Jones (25), Ollie Rayner (17 not out) and Tim Murtagh (19 not out) took Middlesex to a lead of 196 and safety at tea.
Michael Carberry and Jimmy Adams were brought on to bowl, signalling their intentions to agree on a draw, which brought both sides 10 points and moved Hampshire into second place in Division One behind Surrey.
Hampshire captain James Vince told BBC Radio Solent:
""The way the guys fought back from Middlesex being 220-2 in their first innings to get into a position where we were really close to being able to chase a gettable score on that wicket is an incredible effort from everyone.
""The bowlers, having lost Fidel early in the first innings, were outstanding to put in a shift to get us into that position.
""We did exactly what we wanted with the new ball and came within one wicket of probably setting up a 150-run chase in 40-odd overs. So it's huge credit to all the boys.""
Middlesex head coach Richard Scott told BBC Radio London:
""We showed the old resilience of last year when we were up against it.
""When the new ball came, a couple of quick wickets fell, but Ollie Rayner, Toby Roland-Jones and Tim Murtagh were magnificent.
""We put ourselves under the pump this game. We dropped some crucial chances - if we'd have taken those chances we'd at least of had parity after the first innings. But that wasn't to be and I thought they played very well.""",Adam Voges scored 92 as Middlesex's lower order kept Hampshire's bowlers at bay to earn a draw for the champions.
35520820,"An article in Buzzfeed suggesting that the social network was about to introduce what is known as an algorithmic timeline - promoting tweets deemed most relevant rather than publishing them in reverse chronological order - sparked a wave of what can only be described as furious panic.
Under the hashtag #RIPTwitter, thousands, perhaps millions, told the world that this was the end of civilisation as we know it, that a beautiful thing was being crushed, that the company, whose share price has been tumbling for months, was signing its own death warrant.
Finally, the CEO Jack Dorsey was forced to react. ""Hello Twitter!"" he called out. ""Regarding #RIPTwitter: I want you all to know we're always listening. We never planned to reorder timelines next week.""
He went on ""Twitter is live. Twitter is real-time. Twitter is about who & what you follow. And Twitter is here to stay! By becoming more Twitter-y.""
But was Dorsey right to blink in the face of pressure? And should he be ""always listening"" to his users? That depends on whether you believe the hoariest old cliche of management books: ""The customer is always right.""
I certainly sympathise with those who say that Twitter isn't broken, so it does not need the kind of radical fixing implied by an algorithmic timeline. For me, it works just fine, connecting me to like-minded communities of dog-owners, sourdough loaf bakers, and gadget enthusiasts, while providing the best breaking news service on the planet.
Like many other heavy users of Twitter, I have been sniffy about recent innovations such as ""Moments"" and would rather things carried on just as they are. But perhaps Mr Dorsey and his management team should not be listening to people like me - we're almost certainly going nowhere. He has to cock an ear to the concerns of three other constituencies - investors, advertisers and the people who use Twitter infrequently or not at all.
Because the crisis in his company is not about revenues, which are growing nicely, and it's not about what loyal users think - it is about growth. The last set of results showed Twitter user numbers had barely moved over the previous three months, up just four million.
Investors who bought into the business when it floated on the hope that it would grow at the same rate as Facebook, shuddered at that news and will be watching nervously when the next set of results is published on Wednesday. Advertisers are asking why they should spend money with a network when it is not delivering the kind of audience available elsewhere. So Twitter's top team is trying all kinds of tricks to make the experience of joining and using the network more intuitive.
And there's another reason why Jack Dorsey might be tempted to ignore those users protesting about a change that has not even happened yet. If he looks at the history of Facebook, he will see that just about every innovation introduced by Mark Zuckerberg has met with dismay from existing users. Here's how Techcrunch reported the arrival of something called Newsfeed in 2006:
""There has been an overwhelmingly negative public response to Facebook's launch of two new products yesterday. The products, called News Feed and Mini Feed, allow users to get a quick view of what their friends are up to, including relationship changes, groups joined, pictures uploaded, etc., in a streaming news format.""
Petitions were signed, boycotts organised,  but quite soon the News Feed was seen as core to the Facebook experience, and then when it was tweaked there were again protests - from people who thought it was just perfect as it was. By the way, Zuckerberg's reaction to the Newsfeed protests was to say: ""Breathe. We hear youâ€¦"" and then carry on with his original plan.
So the customer is not always right, and if you listen too closely to your existing users, you will end up preserving your site in aspic. That would be fine by me - I like Twitter in its current form.  But maybe Jack Dorsey should ignore me...","For the last 48 hours Twitter has beenâ€¦ well, all of a Twitter."

Transport Minister Keith Brown said: ""The hairpin bend and steep hill at Berriedale Braes has presented drivers with a very challenging road to negotiate - and is why we are working hard towards delivering improvements right along the A9, including at the Braes.""
In August, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) called for work to tackle the bend to be accelerated.

38830552,"After decades of debate, years of acrimony over the issue in the Conservative Party, months of brutal brinksmanship in Westminster, and hours of debate this week, MPs have just approved the very first step in the process of Britain leaving the European Union.
There are many hurdles ahead, probably thousands of hours of debate here, years of negotiations for Theresa May with our friends and rivals around the EU, as she seeks a deal - and possibly as long as a decade of administrative adjustments, as the country extricates itself from the EU.
On a wet Wednesday, the debate didn't feel epoch-making, but think for a moment about what has just happened.
MPs, most of whom wanted to stay in the EU, have just agreed that we are off.
This time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK.
His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero.
Then tonight, his former colleagues are rubber stamping the decision of a narrow majority of the public, that changed everything in politics here for good.

35037772,"Former special constable Debra Martin previously said Kevin Williams spoke to her in the ground's temporary mortuary.
But, intensive care expert Dr Jasmeet Soar said he had not found ""a medical explanation for that"".
He said Kevin's heart was likely to have stopped after 15:30 following an unsuccessful resuscitation attempt.
The teenager was one of 96 people who died following a crush at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989.
Kevin's mother Anne campaigned for more than 20 years for a new inquest into his death, but died before the current hearings began.
Dr Stefan Popper, the coroner who oversaw the original Hillsborough inquests in the early 1990s, ruled all those who died had suffered fatal injuries by 15:15. As such, he said, he did not need to hear evidence on any events after that time.
It was, according to the current coroner Sir John Goldring, a ""highly controversial decision"", which the bereaved families ""strongly disputed"".
The new jurors have heard how the 15:15 cut-off meant the first inquests did not look into whether the police, ambulance service and others handled the aftermath of the disaster properly.
They have now heard evidence that some of the 96 may have been alive after 15:15, with one expert witness saying there was a ""strong possibility"" Jimmy Hennessy was alive on the pitch between 15:15 and 15:20 that day.
Dr Soar, an expert in intensive care medicine and resuscitation, was asked to give his opinion of what happened to Kevin based on the evidence heard about the teenager's movements.
The jury saw how Kevin was carried out of pen three at 15:28, at which point Dr Soar said he was ""deeply unconscious"", ""unresponsive to stimulation"" and did not appear to have ""any body tone or muscle tone"", which was ""significant"" because it indicated he was not conscious.
Kevin was carried on a makeshift stretcher to the opposite end of the pitch, where a group of Liverpool fans and medics tried to resuscitate him after 15:32.
The jury has heard evidence from Derek Bruder, an off-duty Merseyside police officer who was at the match, who said he found a ""slight pulse"" in Kevin.
Dr Soar said Mr Bruder may have felt a ""weak heartbeat"" or he could have been mistaken.
He said a series of photographs of Mr Bruder breathing into Kevin's mouth showed he was carrying out ""textbook, exemplary"" help, but he was confident that following 10 to 15 minutes of CPR, ""there are no signs of life reported by the three individuals, so, yes, he was in cardiac arrest"".
In October, Ms Martin told the inquests she later felt a pulse in Kevin inside the stadium's gymnasium, when he was said to have woken up and said ""mum"".
Dr Soar said he and his colleague Prof Nolan had ""discussed at length"" Ms Martin's evidence.
""We don't think it's possible to be deeply unconscious for that duration and then to restore an adequate level of breathing and oxygen level and blood pressure for the brain to then regain adequate consciousness, then say a single word and then for that process to reverse again.
""So, we don't have a medical explanation for that.""

He took office earlier this year promising to lead the country out of its worst recession in many decades.
Protests against the measure turned violent in the capital Brasilia and at least a dozen states in the country.
The opposition says the measures will mainly hit areas such as health and education, which are already underfunded.
Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets during the Senate session to protest against the austerity plan.
After the vote, many demonstrations descended into violence.
In Brasilia, masked protesters set fire to a bus and marched on the local offices of Globo TV, which they say is biased towards Mr Temer's government. But the marchers were blocked by riot police.
In Sao Paulo, the headquarters of the state's conservative Industrial Federation (Fiesp) was attacked.
To pass the constitutional amendment, the government needed the votes of 49 senators - three-fifths of the Senate.

The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has also banned 15 horses trained by the 37-year-old for six months.
Godolphin is run by the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Q&A - read more
""Al Zarooni acted with recklessness and caused tremendous damage to Godolphin and British racing,"" said the stable's racing manager Simon Crisford.
""I think it will take a very long time for Godolphin to regain the trust of the British public. We're shocked and completely outraged by the actions he has taken.""
Al Zarooni continued to be repentant after hearing of his punishment, saying: ""I apologise to Sheikh Mohammed and all those at Godolphin, and the public who follow racing.
""I accept it was my responsibility to be aware of rules and regulations around banned substances.
""I can only apologise and repeat what I said in my statement earlier in the week - I have made a catastrophic error.""
One of the banned horses is Certify, the former 1,000 Guineas favourite, who will be clear to race again on 9 October 2013, as will the other 14 suspended thoroughbreds.
Eleven horses were caught by drug testing, while Al Zarooni admitted at Wednesday's hearing to doping four others.
Al Zarooni gave the steroids ethylestranol and stanozolol, which are prohibited substances, to his horses and he was charged with violating multiple rules related to banned substances, as well as failing to keep medication records and with conduct prejudicial to the sport.
It's a hefty ban, but one that officials at the British Horseracing Authority say reflects how seriously they take their good record when it comes to drugs in the sport.
Not long ago Mahmood Al Zarooni, personally picked by Sheikh Mohammed to be his trainer, was rated a rising star, yet now his promising career lies in tatters.
Meanwhile, the Sheikh and the huge Godolphin operation will endeavour to re-group, but some of the mud is sure to stick, and things can never be quite the same again.
Steroids are allowed in some countries, including Dubai, out of competition.
Hopefully, this whole episode acts as a catalyst for the world's racing authorities to get their drugs rules consistent across the globe.
BHA chief executive Paul Bittar said he hoped the bans for Al Zarooni and the doped horses ""will serve to reassure the public, and the sport's participants, that use of performance-enhancing substances in British racing will not be tolerated"".
Bittar added: ""We welcome the proactive response of Godolphin and Sheikh Mohammed in announcing their intention to review the procedures of this stable and the need to ensure that all horses formerly trained by Mahmood Al Zarooni are tested and cleared before they race again.
""The BHA will itself consider the wider issues raised by this matter and we will seek to ascertain and collate all other relevant information including, where necessary, interviewing other employees or contractors of Godolphin.""
Sheikh Mohammed, who is worth an estimated £10bn, has ""locked down"" the Moulton Paddock stables in Newmarket where Al Zarooni trained.
Speaking before the ruling, Sheikh Mohammed said he was ""appalled and angered"" by the news that part of his operation ""has violated Godolphin's ethical standards and the rules of British racing"".
He added: ""I have been involved in British horse racing for 30 years and have deep respect for its traditions and rules. There can be no excuse for any deliberate violation.""
Rachel Hood, president of the Racehorse Owners Association, added: ""The ROA was profoundly disturbed by the findings that anabolic steroids had been administered to horses at Moulton Paddocks stables, and we wholeheartedly support the BHA's disciplinary panel in imposing a lengthy ban on Mr Al Zarooni.

""Our sport invests heavily in its integrity services, which includes the BHA undertaking over 8,000 drug tests annually, either on the racecourse or on a random basis at training yards.
""The fact that there have only been two cases of anabolic steroids being detected in recent years supports our view that this was an isolated incident.""
Al Zarooni is one of two UK-based trainers - the other is Saeed bin Suroor - for the powerful Godolphin operation.
Since being appointed by Sheikh Mohammed in March 2010, Al Zarooni has trained a host of big-race winners, including 1,000 Guineas victor Blue Bunting in 2011.

39997585,"The valuation caps a strong month for the virtual currency, with its value growing by more than 65% in a month.
The steady rise in value is believed to be linked to policy changes in Japan and China that have made it easier for speculators to trade in bitcoins.
Many other virtual currencies have also enjoyed a sustained rise in value over the last few weeks.
Bitcoin first broke the $1,000 (£768) barrier in November 2013 but its value has fluctuated wildly since then. For instance, in early 2014 one bitcoin was worth only $280 (£215).
And at the end of 2016, each one was changing hands for about $900 (£690).
Bitcoin emerged in 2008 and is a digital currency based around cryptography. Individual coins can be split into smaller denominations and many people involved with the currency use computers to verify the globally-held log, known as the blockchain, of who spent what where.
Verifying transactions involves solving a complicated mathematical problem and the first person to do so gets rewarded with bitcoins.
Rising interest in bitcoin has sparked the creation of many other crypto-currencies. These have proved popular as the technology underlying bitcoin has struggled to cope with its popularity and growth. One estimate suggests bitcoins now make up only 47% of all traded crypto-currencies.
Rivals such as Ethereum and Ripple have been gaining value far faster than bitcoin over the last few months.
The surging valuations has led some commentators to suggest that an unsustainable crypto-currency bubble is developing.
""The question is not if but when the market will turn,"" said an editorial in The Economist.","The value of Bitcoin has hit a new high with each individual coin now worth more than $2,100 (£1,615)."

The Holyland is a residential part of south Belfast popular with students.

35409903,"People who depend on being able to harvest forest resources should receive payment under the schemes.
But researchers say there is a ""reality gap"" between safeguards designed to help affected communities and who actually receives the compensation.
The findings have been published online in Global Environment Change.
""About 11% of global emissions come from deforestation and degradation of tropical forests so the idea is that if you can slow this down then that can offset emissions and that is good for climate mitigation,"" explained Julia Jones from Bangor University, Wales.
Over the past decade, schemes called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (Redd/Redd+) have been developed as part of the global effort to mitigate climate change.
These mechanisms are designed to improve forest management and reduce the net emission of greenhouse gases in tropical forest and sub-tropical forest nations.
""It finally got approval (at the UN climate summit) in Paris in December that Redd+ will go ahead as a global climate mitigation mechanism,"" Prof Jones told BBC News.
""What that means in reality is more protected areas and more funding. This sounds brilliant, after all it is a win-win situation and what is there not to like about it?""
However, it has been widely acknowledged that such schemes - if not implemented properly - can have a significant negative impact on people's livelihoods, such as indigenous communities, and exacerbate poverty.
""This has been taken on board by, for example, the World Bank,"" observed Prof Jones.
""They have made commitments that anything they fund [and] people are displaced as a result, they must be compensated for it.
""These commitments are also encapsulated in other doctrines, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity.""
But she added: ""The problem is how do you go about doing that? The way that the World Bank guidelines work is that households affected by a scheme must be identified and then compensated for the negative impact of the establishment of a protected area on their livelihoods.""
In order to test whether the commitment to ""social safeguards"" were working on the ground, the team of UK and Madagascan researchers looked in detail at an area within Madagascar where a new protected area was being established.
The work was being funded by the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility.
""We have shown that, yes, they have gone out there and identified households that they think are affected negatively by conservation and have delivered compensation.""
However, she added, the compensation was not reaching those most affected by the project.
""We have mapped every single household that should have been covered by the compensation and have shown thatâ€¦ the process had some very serious biases in it,"" she said.
""Essentially, the people that were identified were easier to reach physically - such as closer to the road or closer to the administrative centre.
""They also tended to be more socially connected; members of local forestry management committees, and they were - on average - richer or, at least, less poor.""
Prof Jones said it was not what would be expected from a scheme that was delivering the help where it was needed most.
""People that are closer to the administrative centre are further away from the forest so they are less dependent on forest resources for their livelihoods,"" she suggested.
""What is interesting here is that the World Bank has very explicit guidelines that it has to be pro-poor and target vulnerable groups. We have shown that it is not working.""
She said the study required researchers to spend a long time in the area in order to learn where all the households were located. In some cases, team members had to walk for eight or nine hours in order to reach some of the most remote communities.
""A criticism is that you can miss households like that if you come in for a short period of time but this is one of the problems;  you cannot expect consultants paid through a World Bank project to be putting in that level of effort to find individual households,"" she added.
""We do not want to be criticising the individual implementers of that particular project but we want to highlight a 'reality gap' between these lovely policies that sound great on paper and the reality on the ground which is that it is incredibly difficult to implement these policies.""
Prof Jones said the study's aim was not to pass judgement on the projects nor the way the compensation scheme was implemented.
There is value pointing out that there is this reality gap,"" she added.
""In countries like Madagascar, there is such poor mapping so when you are planning something like this and you do not have a map that shows villages that have primary schools etc then you are not going to be allocating sufficient resources.
""I would say that whenever there is any sort of effort to implement a conservation scheme then there needs to be an effort to map the human population. Relying on very old and out-of-date maps is not sufficient.""
The team suggested that providing compensation to all households in an affected area would prove to be more financially efficient, as the cost of providing the resources needed to map and assess households ""may not be feasible"".","Remote communities are not receiving the compensation they are entitled to from schemes designed to conserve tropical forests, a study suggests."

He was allegedly paid more than Â£10,000 for 40 tips to reporter Stephen Moyes between 30 April 2006 and 1 May 2011.
Mr Norman, of Swanscombe, Kent, denies the charge against him.
Opening the case at the Old Bailey, prosecutor Julian Christopher QC said Mr Norman was an ""extremely experienced"" prison officer and a member of the Prison Officers Association, acting as union representative to colleagues.
The court heard Mr Norman first phoned the Daily Mirror in 2006 and gave Mr Moyes a story about staff cuts at the prison, for which he was paid Â£400.
The exclusive story described Belmarsh as a ""terror prison"" and ran alongside a photograph of one of its most notorious prisoners, radical preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri, the court heard.
As the relationship developed, it became a ""two-way affair"" and Mr Norman carried on dealing with Mr Moyes when the journalist moved to the News of the World, the court heard.
Mr Christopher said: ""Sometimes Robert Norman would approach Stephen Moyes with something he thought would be of interest, at other times Stephen Moyes would approach Robert Norman for inside information about a topic in which he was interested, or for confirmation which he would not be able to get for free from the official channels at the Ministry of Justice press office.
""Effectively, Robert Norman became the journalist's paid mole within HMP Belmarsh.""
The court heard that when Mr Norman was arrested in 2013 he maintained he had acted in the public interest as a whistleblower.
Cheques for the stories were made out to Mr Norman's son Daniel and the money was then transferred into Mr Norman's account, showing he was ""worried about the trouble he would get into"" if found out, Mr Christopher said.
The trial continues.","A prison officer became the ""paid mole"" of a reporter working at the Daily Mirror and News of the World over five years, a court has heard."

It's not hard to see why. Nostalgia is part of it, these being the remnants of a once great and noble industry, around which large parts of Lanarkshire was built.
It's partly because Clydebridge and Dalzell are symbolic of the impact of globalisation, forcing transition on workers and communities at a local level as the price of enriching the broader economy.
Other parts of Britain and Europe feel the strain of in-migrating people. In Motherwell and Cambuslang, the concern is about out-migrating jobs.
But it's also because there's discomfort that the new economy and the new labour market is unplanned and haphazard, buffeted by market forces and lacking in the security of big plants with jobs-for-life.
It is not always easy to appreciate that Britain has grown quite successfully in recent years by retreating from the making of things.
The service sector makes up 75% of the economy, and while it ranges from high-value finance and professional roles to burger-flipping and care homes, it lacks that noble quality with which the old heavy (and dirty) industries are seen in hindsight.
There is widespread agreement that Britain needs to think again about manufacturing. On the freer market end of things, George Osborne coined the evocative ambition for there to be a ""march of the makers"".
The rhetoric hasn't always matched the policy outcomes. Industrial policy at Westminster now consists of a push towards a more technically literate workforce, and incentives aimed at 11 chosen sectors, ranging across aerospace and automotive to nuclear and wind power, life sciences and professional and business services.
There are also 'catapult centres' for propelling ideas towards the market in robotics, synthetic biology and better batteries.
If you want to see what British manufacturing looks like these days (under German management and with a lot of robots), I'd highly recommend 'Building Cars Live' on the BBC iPlayer for two more weeks. We could do worse than make it required viewing for all secondary school pupils, particularly those with a bad experience of work placements.
Meanwhile, the recent success of Jeremy Corbyn in winning the Labour leadership points to a desire, in some quarters, for a more interventionist government, willing to take control of strategic industries to serve a social purpose in addition to the shareholder one.
So is this time to think again about an industrial policy? Even the Confederation of British Industry, which was closely aligned with the free market orientation of recent governments, wants to see a lot more intervention.
Without it, Mr Osborne may find the makers are marching backwards. Wood Mackenzie, the economic consultancy based in Edinburgh, this week issued its projection of future manufacturing sectors in Europe.
Largely because oil and gas is in decline, it showed Britain as one of only two countries, with Italy, where production is on track to decline.
In the 1960s and 1970s, industrial and regional policies went hand in hand, and got themselves a bad name. In the Sixties, Harold Wilson's Labour government picked industries and locations for them that had more to do with rising unemployment and politics than financial viability.
Ravenscraig had already been chosen as the heart of the steel industry in Scotland. There had been clear advice to locate a new, integrated steel works near a deepwater port, for import of iron ore and export of the steely stuff.
Colvilles, the firm that dominated Lanarkshire steel-making before nationalisation, thought differently.  So did the government. Because steel workers were already in Lanarkshire, it was required that the new steel works should be where the steel communities were. The iron ore should come to them, which until 1978, meant small ships unloading at a rail terminus in central Glasgow.
The government wanted a strip mill to supply the industries it wished to see develop in Scotland. It decided that the plan for an integrated strip mill should be split between Scotland and South Wales.
What's worth noting about this is that the Prime Minister who made the announcement was Harold Macmillan, a Conservative.
It's also worth a brief pause to wonder if the 'Craig steel works had been located at Grangemouth or Hunterston, requiring the workforce to move, the rest might not have been consigned to Scotland's industrial history.
Other big industrial plants from the 1960s came and went. Linwood car plant and Bathgate trucks and buses are ""no more"", as the Proclaimers' song goes, or at least they are utterly changed, into a retail park and commuter housing.
In the Highlands, Invergordon in Easter Ross, and Corpach, near Fort William, joined Dounreay as the government's designated industrial hubs. Neither aluminium nor paper were to perform as hoped at the two ends of the Great Glen.
But as 1 November 2015 is the 50th anniversary of the Highlands and Islands Development Board starting its work, it is worth noting that this government response to de-population and decline was the starting point for a highly successful renaissance of the whole region, even without big industrial plants. ""Lochaber no more""? No more. And more on that before long.
In the 1970s, industrial policy became associated with nationalisation of old, loss-making industries as they lost markets to more efficient competitors far away.
Poor management, terrible industrial relations and inept political interference gave intervention and industrial policy a bad name.
And that was the launch pad for the market-driven 1980s, replacing the old industries with the service sector, and especially finance.  Not only were the old heavy industries privatised, but so were the new ones. The government stake in (at that time) the young industry of offshore oil, was sold off.
Contrast that with our North Sea neighbour. For all the talk of Norway's enormous fund from keeping the proceeds of North Sea oil, there's little discussion now of how much better Norway has done by holding on to a very large portion of the equity in its offshore assets, as well as its tax take from them. Statoil is anything but a lumbering nationalised dinosaur.
Other European countries have done significantly better than Britain at transforming old industrial heartlands. That's according to Professor Andrew Cumbers at Glasgow University, whose research into Germany, France and the UK makes uncomfortable reading for the economic departments in Whitehall.
They chose the strategic manufacturing industries they wanted, and made sure they were protected and provided with investment.
This was not with simple subsidy for losses incurred, but with state-controlled industrial investment banks, willing to take the long view with much cheaper and more attractive lending conditions than UK firms. In Germany, these banks were usually regional.
So both an industrial and regional policy combined to ensure that strategic industries survived and often thrived. Professor Cumbers points out that successful developed countries have retained their own steel-making sectors, including the Netherlands, Belgium and the USA.
Total output went up faster in the Old Industrial Regions of the UK, but employment growth was in the service sector rather than helping the march of the makers.
Cumbers also points to a weakness of the UK's dependence on inward investment - that when companies contract, foreign headquarters are more willing to sacrifice distant plants. The fate of Britain's steel industry currently rests on decisions made in corporate headquarters in Bangkok and Mumbai.
Recent decades show that the relative decline of manufacturing with the growth of the service sector is a widespread phenomenon that accompanies economic development.
Economic theory says you shouldn't need to make your steel locally if it can be more efficiently produced elsewhere and imported. Britain is a very rare example of a country that seems willing to put that theory to the test.
And given that it maintains a shipbuilding capacity on the Clyde to protect its strategic security interests - in being able to build warships for the Royal Navy - it is odd that it does not also insist on protection for the steel industry that supplies the Govan and Scotstoun yards.","There's a retro vibe afoot: the planned mothballing of two steel plants in Lanarkshire brings back the 1980s as if it were... well, 30 years ago."

Jones played well over 200 matches for Llanelli and Scarlets and returned to west Wales as a backs coach in 2015 after a spell as part of Dai Young's coaching team at Wasps.
Pivac believes he has a future at international level.

Jones scored 917 points in 104 appearances for Wales and played fly-half in six Test matches for the British and Irish Lions.
He is now sharing his expertise with Scarlets stand-off Rhys Patchell, a combination Pivac says is key to the team's success.

33758162,"The star, who had a string of pop hits in the 1960s before presenting TV shows like Blind Date and Surprise Surprise in the '80s, died on Saturday, aged 72.
A book of condolence has been opened in her home city at Liverpool Town Hall.
Childhood friend Terry McCann said Black told him she knew she was going to die and her beloved late husband Bobby Willis was ""waiting for me"".
A post-mortem examination has been carried out. The results may not be officially published for several days or possibly weeks, but Spanish police have said the indications point towards natural causes.
BBC News correspondent Robert Hall - who is in the resort of Estepona where Black lived - said she was found on her balcony by her son who was staying nearby.
He said paramedics arrived at around 18:00 local time (17:00 BST) but were unable to save her.
Mr McCann said he had seen the star in Spain during the last year.
""I wasn't surprised when I found out she had died,"" he told BBC News.
""The last thing she said to me was she was going blind, she showed me her hands, she had arthritis,"" he said. ""She willed herself to die. She said, 'Bobby's waiting for me.'
""Her mother went the same way. I don't know what her mother died of but it seemed she associated it with her mother's death and she just knew it was going to happen.
""She just said, 'Look at me, I'm a wreck.' I was trying to cheer her up. She knew something we didn't.
""She knew she was going to die and she said she wasn't going to linger like her mother.
""Her mother was ill for two years and she had the same complaint and she said she was never going to linger like that.""
Liverpool City Council say that between 400 and 500 people have so far left messages in a book of condolence at the town hall, where the flag is also flying at half mast. The book will be open to the public until Friday.
Fans signing the book on Monday included:
Sylvia Lewis (above): ""Occasionally I used to work on the cloakroom at the Cavern with her. One Saturday, when I wasn't [working], Cilla was the cloakroom girl. When it came to the end of the evening my coat had gone. Cilla had given it away to somebody else! I met Cilla at the Pride of Britain Awards every year and she always used to come up to me and say 'Girl, do you remember your coat? And we never found it, did we?'""
Ann Stalker: ""I absolutely love her. She was an icon from my era. I just wanted to pay my respects. I wrote: 'Ta-ra Cilla. You were a credit to us all. Rest in peace.'""
Cheryl McFarlane: ""She's somebody I remember so much and love very much. She's got a beautiful family and she was so wonderful to Liverpool. I just wanted to come and visit and say rest in peace.""
Since Black's death, tributes have poured in from figures ranging from UK Prime Minister David Cameron to Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr - who knew Black from the Merseybeat scene in the '60s.
Sir Paul described her as ""a lovely girl who infected everyone with her great spirit.""
TV presenter Gloria Hunniford said Black never really got over the ""deep loss"" of her husband in 1999.
""Bobby was wonderful. Wonderful as a manager and wonderful as a husband,"" Hunniford told BBC 5 live. ""She was a one-boy girl and I don't think she ever got over the vacuum of the loneliness that Bobby left.""
Actress Barbara Windsor said: ""I've seen her twice in the last few weeks. As always she looked immaculate. But I knew she wasn't very well. She didn't seem very well.""
Morrissey, who covered Black's single Work is a Four-Letter Word with The Smiths, also paid tribute.
""Never stationary throughout the 1960s, Cilla Black made some great records - The Right One Is Left, Suffer Now I Must, It's For You, I've Been Wrong Before, What Good Am I?
""I'm very grateful for the songs, and it never occurred to me that such people could die.""
Mr McCann grew up near Black and her family on Scotland Road in Liverpool.
He discovered her vocal talents when they listened to music as youngsters.
""She used to play records and sing along with them. That's when I realised. I was working at a club called The Iron Door and coaxed her to get up and sing. That was the first time she sang in public.
""Everyone was surprised by how good she was but she was very, very nervous. Eventually her confidence grew later on.""
Mr McCann arranged an audition for Black with EMI - but The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein later won her signature and took over as her manager.
Promoter Sam Leach put on the gig at The Iron Door and recalled how she ran to the toilets in tears afterwards.
""I'd realised how good she was,"" Mr Leach said. ""She was like [gospel singer] Mahalia Jackson. So when she came out I said, 'You've got a lovely voice.'""
However, she said no when Mr Leach asked her to perform the following week. ""She said, 'I'm not going to do it, I made a fool of myself,'"" Mr Leach said. ""I ignored that and put an advert in the [Liverpool] Echo.""
She had little choice but to perform the next week, Mr Leach added: ""She was brilliant. Absolutely fantastic. She gave me a big hug and said, 'Thanks, I should have listened to you.'
""That was the start of her career.""","Cilla Black was ailing and ""willed herself to die"", according to a long-time friend."

39360431,"The Times reported that telecoms firms AT&T and Verizon, as well as car rental company Enterprise and pharmaceutical giant GSK, have withdrawn all non-search advertising.
An investigation by the newspaper found major brands were appearing next to YouTube videos promoting extremist views - generating revenues for the creators.
The company has apologised and promised better tools for advertisers.
Despite Google’s efforts to contain the row, which began in the UK earlier this week, it appears to have now caught the attention of the US advertising industry - creating a huge problem for Google as it seeks to reassure brands their ad spend is not funding hate groups.
According to The Times, Verizon’s advertisements were appearing along side videos made by Wagdi Ghoneim, an Egyptian cleric who had been banned from the US over extremism, and Hanif Qureshi, whose teachings inspired the assassination of a Pakistani politician.
“We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” AT&T said in a statement on Wednesday.
""Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.”
The UK-based investigation led more than 250 brands to pull their advertising. In a blog post published on Monday, Google’s chief business officer Philipp Schindler announced the company was expanding its policies on hate speech to include videos targeting vulnerable groups.
In response to the latest boycott from the US brands, Google said on Wednesday: “We’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear.”
“We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.”
Google is the dominant player in online advertising, and ads are by far the company’s biggest source of money. In 2016, the firm generated $80bn in ad revenue - accounting for almost 90% of the firm’s total income for the year.
Of the boycotts announced on Wednesday, both Verizon and AT&T have major online advertising ambitions of their own. Verizon in particular recently agreed to purchase embattled web portal firm Yahoo for $4.48bn - a deal it hopes will help it compete with Google for ad sales.

23419036,"Scientists found that the long dry spell that year - the UK's most intense drought between 1914 and 2006 - killed off many drought-sensitive beech trees.
Growth of the trees is still restricted more than 30 years later, a study in the journal Functional Ecology said.
The more drought-tolerant Sessile Oak survived better and is now dominating the beech.
The scientific work was carried out at Lady Wood Park in the Wye Valley. This 45 hectare (111 acre) site is a national nature reserve and is attractive to researchers because it has been deliberately unmanaged since 1945.
Detailed forest surveys have been carried out in the park over the past 70 years and the ecologists were able to use these along with tree ring data to discover how the different tree species fared over the period.
Before 1976, beech was the dominant species in this area. But that summer's drought has permanently changed the makeup of the forest.
That dry spell was the most exceptional drought in the years between 1914 and 2006 - it was 30% more intense than the next driest year, 1921.
The researchers found that in the period immediately after 1976, there was a significant growth in beech mortality. Between 1977 and 1992, 17% of these trees died, while there were no deaths among the oaks.
""The beech growth dropped very suddenly,"" said Prof Alistair Jump from the University of Stirling who carried out the work along with researchers from Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
""The Sessile Oak which is slightly less competitive but is more drought tolerant took advantage and grew much better - and beech has never fully recovered in the system.""
The researchers say the oaks increased their growth rate by approximately 20% in the years immediately after 1976. The beech trees eventually stabilised their growth rate but only at around 75% of pre-drought levels.
The scientists say that beech trees can appear to tolerate drought without a long term impact until a threshold is reached.
""I think tipping point is a key idea, and that's something that we see very clearly in the work,"" said Prof Jump.
""They are resistant up to a point and then we hit a tipping point and the system shows very severe impacts.  The problem is we don't know where these tipping points are for other species.""
The researchers say they expect the changes that they recorded at Lady Park Wood to have been replicated across the UK.
This perspective is echoed by Ray Townsend, arboretum manager at the Royal Botanic Gardens, at Kew.
He lived through the drought of 1976 and owns a home in the New Forest and he has been spending a good deal of time among the beech trees there in recent months.
""Quite clearly you can see that the beech aren't happy,"" he told BBC News.
""You can see evidence of the restriction of growth - I've seen that, the beech don't look as they should look - The oaks seem to be growing well, I'd never really thought about the reasons, but reading the research paper, it makes sense in a way.""
The study's authors believe that extreme events such as the drought of 1976 are likely to increase in frequency in the future and there could be similar implications for other tree species.
To cope with these events, they say that forest managers need to manipulate the mix of species in their woods.
But despite the extreme heat of the last few weeks, the scientists say that 2013 will not have the same impact on trees as the dry days of '76.  That year was exceptional as it followed on from a rain-free 1975.
""This summer it won't happen,"" said Prof Jump.
""Last year we were at the point where we were forecast to exceed the 1976 drought and then we had this phenomenal amount of rain  - that replenished the water supplies and that means for this year it would be highly unlikely.""

38703592,"The rescue means that nine people have been recovered alive from the Rigopiano hotel in the eastern Abruzzo region.
At least 15 people are still missing after the avalanche that came after several earthquakes and heavy snowfall.
While one more survivor has yet to be rescued, Italian media said other voices may have been heard in the ruins during the night.
Five people have been confirmed dead.
The first five survivors were taken to safety on Friday, some 40 hours after the avalanche hit on Wednesday.
They had reportedly taken refuge beneath a collapsed portion of ceiling, where they were able to light a fire to keep warm for two days.
The rescue has been hampered by deep snow blocking an access road.
There are also concerns that further avalanches could follow, Italian newspaper La Stampa reported.
The first person pulled out on Friday was an eight-year-old boy, the son of a holidaymaker, Giampiero Parete, who had gone to his car when the avalanche struck and first sounded the alarm by calling his boss.
The boy's mother, Adriana, was pulled out next, telling rescue workers her six-year-old daughter was still trapped inside.
The little girl was also later saved and the family was reunited at a hospital in the coastal town of Pescara.
Hospital officials told the Associated Press news agency they had symptoms of hypothermia and dehydration, but were otherwise in good health.
Reports said all four children who survived did so because they were all playing in the same games room, that avoided the worst of the damage.
The latest rescues, of two men and two women, took place at about 03:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Saturday.
Wednesday's earthquakes included four stronger than magnitude 5, in a region already struggling with heavy snowfall that buried phone lines and took out power cables.
Many of the guests had gathered on the ground floor of the hotel to await evacuation following the earthquakes.
But the avalanche completely buried the hotel at about 17:00 (16:00 GMT) on Wednesday.
The force of the snow partially brought down the roof and, according to some reports, shifted the building 10m (32 feet) off its foundations.
Rescuers, who were forced to ski and shovel their way towards the site of the avalanche, were reportedly only dispatched hours later.
Rescuers are unsure of the exact total of people - guests and staff - who were at the hotel, but say it could be as many as 35.

35235293,"The BBC found a disregard for health and safety on an estate in north-east India owned by Assam Company.
The Rainforest Alliance, an ethical certification organisation, has now stripped a group of Assam Company's plantations of its green frog seal.
The Assam Company said it was appealing against the decision. A group of Assam Company's estates lost its certification because ""it was found to be in breach of critical criteria relating to the use of personal protective equipment"", the Rainforest Alliance said in a statement.
The Assam Company said the loss of its certification was because of a ""minor error"" on one estate - Hajua - while spraying a plant extract, which it understood did not require personal protective equipment. It said that because the Assam company estates operate in a ""single cluster"", the other estates were automatically decertified.
Twinings, Taylors of Harrogate and Fortnum & Mason have suspended business with the company while Harrods took the tea off its shelves shortly after the investigation, which was broadcast in September.
Workers at the company's Hajua estate were seen spraying agrochemicals without the protective equipment employers are required to provide, when the BBC visited.
Men spraying reported breathing difficulties, numbness of the hands and face, a burning sensation on the skin and profound loss of appetite.
The Rainforest Alliance said its auditor confirmed the BBC's evidence of unsafe spraying and the organisation had tightened its rules on the subject.
Taylors of Harrogate said it will maintain a relationship with the estates and support efforts to improve standards.
Twinings plans to continue working with the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP) - an organisation set up by UK tea companies to improve workers' lives - to monitor the working and living conditions on all the tea estates from which it buys. It also plans to conduct a review of the Assam estates it sources from in the next few months.
Because of the way ETP and the Rainforest Alliance work together, a Rainforest suspension automatically results in a suspension of ETP certification.
Fortnum & Mason says it will not buy from Assam Company until its ""problems have been successfully resolved and they are once again Ethical Tea Partnership certified"".
The original investigation also found workers on a number of Assam estates and plantations belonging to other producers living in broken houses with terrible sanitation.
The Assam Company said it was ""committed to the practices of sustainability and work to this end is in progress, with most of the work on housing, latrines and creche being planned after the closure of the plucking season, in December to March."" It said this had been company practice for ""many years"".
The Rainforest Alliance has ordered improvements to living conditions on two other plantations, owned by the world's biggest tea producer, McLeod Russel.
The Moran and Behora tea estates supply the companies that own PG Tips and Tetley, as well as Twinings.
Many workers were found to be living in leaking homes, without electricity. Many of the latrines had been blocked or broken for many years and families said they had no choice but to defecate among the tea bushes.
A manager on the Moran estate admitted there was ""a huge backlog of repairs"" but the Rainforest Alliance did not decertify McLeod Russel's Assam estates because decent housing and sanitation were ""not critical criteria"".
However, the Rainforest Alliance has admitted flaws in its audit process and last month made its criteria more demanding. Now any estates failing to provide adequate housing, water supply and sanitation will lose their green frog seal of approval.
The Rainforest Alliance has given Mcleod Russel two months to improve conditions for tea workers on the Moran and Behora plantations.
Unilever, which makes PG Tips, told the BBC it welcomes the fact that improvements on areas like housing and health and safety are being accelerated and will be subject to additional monitoring.
Tata, which makes Tetley, said it has met with the producers to understand their plans to address the issues the BBC uncovered. It has been in discussion with the Rainforest Alliance and says it is committed to the fair and ethical treatment of people across its supply chain.
McLeod Russel says work on homes and sanitation on its Moran tea estate has now been accelerated and will be completed by March. It has also improved drainage and laid concrete paths to workers' homes.
The BBC has been told that conditions on the estate have already improved.
""There has been a change on the Moran estate,"" says Mohesh Ghatawar, a campaigner with the All Adivasi Students Association of Assam. ""Work has started to repair people's homes. And after a meeting with the tea workers' unions we've been told workers will get new toilets and sanitation soon.""
The investigation has had an impact beyond India. The Rainforest Alliance has ordered improvements on all the estates it certifies worldwide, including housing conditions, sanitation and access to drinking water.",Three of the UK's top tea brands have stopped buying from a group of Indian plantations after a BBC investigation exposed dangerous working conditions.

He once again helped rescue England's flaky batting as he hit an unbeaten 107 at a sun-kissed Lord's.
Together with 85 from skipper Alastair Cook, Bairstow's third ton in six Tests dragged the hosts out of a hole in near-perfect conditions for batting.
Rash strokeplay mixed with disciplined bowling from Sri Lanka had reduced Cook's men to 84-4 just after lunch.
But Bairstow profited from a dropped catch and then the most marginal of lbw decisions to continue his wonderful early summer run of form.
Not since beating India 4-0 in the summer of 2011 have England whitewashed a Test opponent in a series of three or more matches.
And while the weather forecast for the remainder of the match is uncertain, Bairstow's fightback has given them a hold in a contest that had been drifting Sri Lanka's way.

While England have improved both in style and substance over the course of the last year, serious flaws remain - and the vulnerability of the top order is the most pressing of all.
On a true pitch and under benign skies, they once again lost key wickets cheaply - four this time for 28 runs, having chosen to bat and looked completely untroubled in the first hour of play.
First Alex Hales lost patience, having been kept runless for 22 balls, heaving unnecessarily at Rangana Herath to send a looping edge to Angelo Mathews at slip.
Then Nick Compton, mired in a horrible trot of form and seemingly bereft of confidence, chased a wide half-volley and edged Suranga Lakmal behind for just one.
Joe Root followed four runs later, pinned lbw by the same bowler after the initial not-out decision was correctly overturned by the third umpire, and when James Vince had his bail removed by Nuwan Pradeep for 10 just after lunch, England had slumped from 56-0 to 84-4.
Compton's dismissal was the most chastening of all: to a ball that should have been routinely driven away for four, greeted by a ghastly silence from the near capacity crowd, followed by a slow walk back to the old pavilion, Lord's suddenly the loneliest place in London.
It could have been worse had Shaminda Eranga held on to a straightforward chance at mid-wicket when Bairstow was on 11, the ball flying straight into his hands and out again.
But the Yorkshireman, a stark contrast to Compton this summer in terms of sweet touch and confident animation at the crease, continued to play his shots with Cook in more sedate style at the other end.
Cook reached his fifty off 89 balls - his first half-century of the series - and the only surprise was that his unflustered progress ended on 85, Pradeep trapping him lbw with a fine inswinger from round the wicket.
Bairstow then had his second life, given not out to an lbw shout from Eranga on 56 when the review indicated that the ball appeared to be hitting enough off leg stump to send it cartwheeling away.

Had the original decision been out he would have been walking, but instead he settled in with first Moeen Ali and then Chris Woakes as afternoon turned to evening and the ball lost its shine and shape.
By his aggressive standards it was a patient innings, but when offered anything overpitched or wide by a hard-working and parsimonious attack, he took full advantage.
His first Test century at Lord's came with a tickle off the hip from his 160th ball as the evening shadows stretched across the pitch, and he celebrated in fitting style - helmet off, arms stretched out wide to the grateful crowd.

39401569,"Southgate was delighted with aspects of England's display in defeat in the friendly against Germany in Dortmund on Wednesday while the unspectacular win against Lithuania was all about getting three more points towards World Cup qualification.
So what will Southgate take away from the last week as England look ahead to their next qualifier in Scotland on 10 June?
Southgate set the normal rules about strikers and age aside to bring 34-year-old Jermain Defoe back into the England fold four years after his last goal for his country, scored in a victory against San Marino.
Injuries to main striker Harry Kane and all-time record goalscorer Wayne Rooney forced Southgate's hand but he was able to call on the hard evidence provided by Defoe's 14 Premier League goals in a Sunderland side renowned for not making chances and rooted to the bottom of the table.
Defoe has always traded in the game's most important currency, goals, throughout his lengthy career. This was a performance designed to demonstrate to doubters and Southgate he has not outlived his usefulness at international level.
He was sharp and saw one chance saved before he demonstrated his poacher's instinct in the penalty area to slide in Adam Lallana's pass in the 21st minute before flashing another shot narrowly off target.
In many respects he is an old-fashioned attacking operator in that his first thought is always the back of the net and shooting at it. No extra touches or passes are required. Defoe had two shots on target, one off target and one blocked with very limited opportunities - but most significantly made England's breakthrough.
He is selfish in just the right way and in a World Cup qualifying group where England will be confronted by the sort of mass defence Lithuania presented here, it is unlikely this will be a temporary return to the colours.
Dele Alli was given heavy-handed - or more precisely heavy-footed - treatment from Lithuania as they tried to light the short fuse that has brought Tottenham's 20-year-old some unsavoury headlines in his short career.
It meant Alli was nowhere near as influential as he was in Dortmund on Wednesday, where his efforts will have imprinted his importance for both the present and the future in Southgate's mind.
With Alli subdued, this was the chance for Liverpool's Adam Lallana to step forward and confirm his progression into a fully-fledged first-choice member of this England side.
The 28-year-old is a late developer for England but his rejuvenation under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is now reaping dividends for Southgate as a very important spin-off.
Lallana has been directly involved in four goals in his last five England appearances, three goals and one assist, and was unlucky to strike the post in Germany.
He combined natural energy and creation with subtlety at Wembley, the qualities needed to make a difference in an attacking framework with England - with his beautiful, imaginative touch inside a crowded penalty the perfect invitation for Jamie Vardy to make the game safe against Lithuania.
If his Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson and Tottenham's Eric Dier can provide a solid midfield shield for England's defence and freedom for those further forward, Southgate will hope Alli and Lallana will flourish even more on the road to Russia.
Jermain Defoe showed exactly what a natural goalscorer can bring to England - which is why Southgate will want Tottenham's Harry Kane restored to full fitness as soon as possible.
England have players who can score goals, as Vardy also proved, with Wayne Rooney not willing to take a back seat yet and youngsters such as Marcus Rashford ready to stake their claim.
But Kane, still only 23 and with 19 goals and four assists for Spurs in the Premier League this season, is the class act Southgate will want fully recovered from his ankle injury to spearhead England through the rest of the campaign.
Kane, and he was not alone here, endured a miserable Euro 2016 perhaps memorable only for then manager Roy Hodgson's puzzling decision to put a proven goalscorer (and a tall proven goalscorer at that) on corner-taking duty.
He has endured a dry spell with England, with five goals in 17 appearances, but his performances at club level this season have shown further maturity and he has the sort of mature and measured personality that could yet mark him out as a future England captain.
Kane is currently recovering from ankle ligament damage and is weeks away from full fitness - but in the long-term he will be a centrepiece of Southgate's plans as the man to take the opportunities England missed in Germany and against Lithuania.
Burnley's Michael Keane has been the beneficiary of Gareth Southgate's willingness to move outside the Premier League elite with his selection policy and the opportunities that can suddenly present themselves at international level.
Keane moved up the England pecking order when Phil Jones hurt his toe in collision with Manchester United team-mate Chris Smalling and had to withdraw from the squad before the Germany game - and got another chance following his fine debut with Gary Cahill suspended and Smalling an injury casualty for the Lithuania qualifer.
The 24-year-old slotted in perfectly to a three-man defence alongside Smalling and Cahill in Germany and was an able partner to John Stones against Lithuania, although the lack of serious attacking threat from England's opposition in Sunday's game must be used as context.
Keane has, however, given the impressive initial impression that he has the composure and concentration for international football and has been one of the major positives for Southgate and England this week.

Once again England's route to a major tournament does not seem to have an obstacle in sight - a familiar journey to what might prove to be a dangerous final destination.
England and Southgate have no excuses for failing to progress to Russia from a group containing Slovakia, Slovenia, Scotland, Lithuania and Malta and all the evidence suggests it will be as straightforward as expected.
It was the same under former manager Roy Hodgson and England's untroubled qualifying campaign for Euro 2016, which brought an unblemished 10 wins out of 10 against Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and San Marino.
England set off for France with optimism but only recorded one win against Wales before the embarrassing exit against Iceland in the last 16.
The conundrum for Southgate is that the true measure of England's progress and test of how far they have come under his tutelage may only be revealed when they are faced with a higher-class of opposition in a competitive environment.
One of Southgate's major tasks between now and what looks like certain qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia is to find a way of discovering just how good this England team is - and how to uncover any flaws before the serious business begins.",Gareth Southgate will feel a sense of cautious optimism after his first two matches as permanent England manager in succession to Sam Allardyce - but some familiar questions remain.
14824435,"The 1.9-million-year-old fossils were first described in 2010, and given the species name Australopithecus sediba.
But the team behind the discovery has now come back with a deeper analysis.
It tells Science magazine that features seen in the brain, feet, hands and pelvis of A. sediba all suggest this species was on the direct evolutionary line to us - Homo sapiens.
""We have examined the critical areas of anatomy that have been used consistently for identifying the uniqueness of human beings,"" said Professor Lee Berger from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg
""Any one of these features could have evolved separately, but it is highly unlikely that all of them would have evolved together if A. sediba was not related to our lineage,"" the team leader informed BBC News.
It is a big claim and, if correct, would sideline other candidates in the fossil record for which similar assertions have been made in the past.
Theory holds that modern humans can trace a line back to a creature known as Homo erectus which lived more than a million years ago. This animal, according to many palaeoanthropologists, may in turn have had its origins in more primitive hominins, as they are known, such as Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis.
The contention now made for A. sediba is that, although older than its ""rivals"", some of its anatomy and capabilities were more advanced than these younger forms. Put simply, it is a more credible ancestor for H. erectus, Berger's team claims.
The sediba specimens were unearthed at Malapa in the famous Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site, just to the northwest of Jo'burg.
They were pulled from a pit - a depression left in the ground by a cave complex that had lost its roof through erosion over time.
Identified as an adult female and a juvenile male, the two individuals were quite possibly mother and son.  What seems certain is that they died together in some tragic accident that saw them either fall into the cave complex or become stuck in it. After death, their bodies were washed into a pool and cemented in time along with the remains of many other animals that got trapped in the same way.
In the months since their 2010 announcement, Professor Berger and colleagues have subjected the remains to further detailed assessment.
X-ray scans reveal ape-man's brain
Age: The latest dating technologies were applied to the sediments encasing the fossils.  Whereas original estimates had put the age of the remains at somewhere between 1.78 and 1.95 million years old, the new analysis has narrowed this window of uncertainty to just 3,000 years. The new age is now between 1.977 and 1.98 million years old.  The refined dating is important, says the team, because it puts A. sediba deep enough in time to be a realistic ancestor to H. erectus.
Dr Robyn Pickering, from the University of Melbourne, Australia, who led the dating, told BBC News: ""This is a very interesting time in human evolution because it is when we think we should be seeing the beginnings of our genus, Homo.  Previously, we've had very few fossils from this time period, so the sediba fossils are remarkable in that they are so complete.""
Brain: A high-resolution X-ray scan of the male specimen's skull has produced a virtual cast of its braincase. This was carried out at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble. From this, the researchers estimate an adult A. sediba's brain to have been about 440 cubic centimetres in volume, or about the size of a medium grapefruit. This is smaller than much older fossils in the record such as the famous ""Lucy"" specimen, Australopithecus afarensis (3.2 million years), but, intriguingly, the shape is more human-like, especially at the front.  This may hint at the start of the re-organisation of the brain that would be necessary to make us what we are today.
Pelvis: The pelvis is short and broad like a human pelvis.  A more ancient creature like Lucy has a flatter and more flaring pelvis. A popular idea has been that the modern human pelvis evolved in tandem with the gradual growth in brain volume - facilitating the birth of babies with bigger heads.  A. sediba gives the lie to this theory, says the team, because it had a modern-looking pelvis while possessing a small brain.
Hand: The right-hand of the female is very nearly complete.  It is looks far more like a modern human hand than an ape hand. Its fingers are shorter relative to the thumb than in a chimpanzee.  And yet, it appears to have possessed powerful muscles for grasping, suggesting A. sediba spent a lot of time clambering through the branches of trees. The team also argues that the dexterity would have been there to make simple tools.
Foot: The ankle joint is mostly human-like in form and there is some evidence for a human-like arch and Achilles tendon. But A. sediba possessed an ape-like heel and lower tibia, or shin bone.  The scientists think this combination may have led to a distinctive type of walk when the creature was not climbing in trees.
Whatever the correctness of the analysis, the creature certainly has a fascinating mix of features - some archaic, some modern.
Independent scientists describe the fossils as exquisite and utterly fascinating.
Dr William Harcourt-Smith from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, commented: ""One lineage of Australopithecus almost certainly led into the first member of our own genus called Homo, and from then eventually emerged modern humans.
""But some of them are side branches, and we're trying to work out which ones are and which ones aren't - and that's why this finding is so important. In many ways, these fossils are the 'smoking gun' just before the emergence of our own genus.""
And Professor Chris Stringer, from London's Natural History Museum, told BBC News: ""This isn't the end of the story. What may be happening is that there were several australopithecine forms all evolving human-like features in parallel as they turned to meat-eating and tool-making and moving greater distances.
""The question now is to pull out of this mess which one is really the ancestor of the genus Homo.  We know there are more remains to come from this incredible site.  Let's see if other individuals also show this mix of features.""

But for Mr Mandela, the garden held a special value. And if you stand inside the tiny cell where South Africa's struggle icon spent 18 years hidden from the world, and peer through the barred window into the high-walled courtyard, you can just make out the thin strip of green and brown foliage where he once tended tomatoes and chillies.
""A garden was one of the few things in prison that one could controlâ€¦ The sense of being the custodian of this small patch of earth offered a small taste of freedom,"" Mr Mandela wrote in his autobiography, Long Walk To Freedom - an early draft of which, incidentally, he tried to hide from the prison guards by burying in the garden.
Today, the garden's weeds - and the rotting stump of an apple tree - hint at the alleged mismanagement and corruption that have blighted Robben Island for years.
But along one wall, two grape vines now stand out in sharp contrast - the lush green foliage of a promising harvest suspended on a wooden frame.
""They're still growing, thriving, regardless of the difficult conditions on the island. They're very much a symbol of the resilience of the leaders imprisoned here,"" said Philip Jonker, a South African wine maker as he and two colleagues carefully pruned the vines by hand.
It is seven years since Mr Jonker first spotted the two plants on a family visit to the island.
It is not clear whether Mr Mandela himself tended the vines or whether, as seems more likely, they were planted shortly after he was transferred to another prison on the mainland. But Mr Jonker sees them - there are seven vines around the prison in total - as part of the island's heritage, and a way of preserving ""South African history in a bottle"".
After four years of petitioning, he finally secured permission to tend the vines, and, last year, to take the first harvest - previous ones had been devoured by the island's ravenous birds - back to his Weltevrede family wine estate two hours' drive east of Cape Town.
At this moment - leaving aside the current headlines about low pay and grim conditions in the local wine industry  - you may be wondering if this is simply another potentially uncomfortable attempt to exploit the Mandela ""brand"".
The short answer is no. Although Weltevrede will surely not mind the publicity.
""Mandela is my grape father,"" said Weltevrede worker Jan Blaauw, with a broad grin, as he and Mr Jonker pulled away some dead branches.
The staff make regular trips to the island - their progress with the vines offering an increasingly sharp contrast with the visible neglect seen elsewhere here.
Mr Mandela ""brought us everythingâ€¦ Freedom. This is my way to pay him back for all he has done for me,"" said Mr Blaauw.
Thirty workers at Weltevrede have been given their own small vineyard to farm as part of an empowerment scheme designed to help address the economic legacies of apartheid.
Any profits from the auction of the wine will be split between the workers' trust, another local charity, and an organisation helping disadvantaged families of former Robben Island political prisoners.
Not that significant profits are assured. The harvest is small, to put it mildly.
Back at the family estate, in a stunning valley surrounded by mountains, Mr Jonker sniffed and then sipped a sample of the Methode Cap Classique sparkling white wine that is still fermenting.
Sixteen small bottles of sweet white dessert wine have already been produced and the aim is to fill 94 magnums with the sparkling wine.
It is still not clear exactly which grape variety is growing on Robben Island, but Mr Jonker believes the quality will be high, and is now trying to research the world of charity auctions.
The workers at the farm appear to share Mr Jonker's enthusiasm.
""It can benefit our children. It's a great experience because I can go out and say I own vines and I can make wine, and we also make wine for Mandela. He showed us how to look forward and not to look back,"" said Maggie Kawula, standing beside a row of Pinot Noir vines owned by the workers' trust.
The magnums won't be ready for auction for at least a year or so. But having sipped a tiny mouthful of the half-fermented vintage - which will be called The Manuscript, in reference to the story about Mr Mandela burying his autobiography in the prison garden - I can tell you it tastes just fine.
""In another 50 or maybe 100 years' time those vines may still be alive and those may be the only living monuments of the times of our great leaders on the island,"" said Mr Jonker.","In the sun-bleached corner of Nelson Mandela's old prison yard on Robben Island, the desiccated remains of a tiny, weed-ridden garden lie exposed and sadly neglected."

After leaving South Africa in protest against the racial quota system - which insisted on a certain number of non-white players in every team - and qualifying to play for England through the Kolpak rule, Pietersen announced himself with three one-day centuries against the country of his birth in early 2005.
He went on to play a decisive role in England's historic Ashes victory over Australia later that year, making back-to-back fifties on his Test debut at Lord's and sealing the series with a breathtaking 158 at The Oval.
The sheer audacity with which Pietersen took on the team that had dominated the game for more than a decade was jaw-dropping, but as he reveals to Flintoff, his close relationship with Australian talisman Warne - they were team-mates at Hampshire - was one of the major reasons why he settled so quickly into Ashes cricket.

""Having the great Shane Warne as my mate, walking onto the field and not having him hammer me from first slip, but just laugh and have a joke helped a lot,"" says Pietersen.
""I think I could have been fearful playing Australia but because this huge figure was a mate of mine, it calmed things down.""
There was nothing calm about the celebrations that followed England's Ashes win as the players famously partied the night away before arriving at a Downing Street reception the next morning somewhat the worse for wear.
One photograph shows a sozzled-looking Flintoff and Pietersen arm in arm outside Number 10, the former with eyelids sagging over reddened pupils and the latter looking bedraggled with a loose tie, sunglasses and a haircut which he jokingly refers to as ""the skunk"".
As they reminisce over the mayhem, Pietersen is less certain than Flintoff that he would do the same again.
""The reason I don't enjoy [looking back] is that I can't remember it,"" he says.
""We probably deserved it because we had just beaten Australia and I think winning series like that need to be enjoyed but I also remember beating Australia in Australia and winning the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean and thinking 'do you know what, just enjoy it, just walk around and take it in'.

""I will never forget Barbados, and I will never forget Sydney. In 2005 the emotions took over and we ended up all over the place that evening, but I haven't done it that way since.""
After the boozing came the backlash, and the painful memory for both players of the 5-0 whitewash by Australia in the return Ashes series down under. With Warne now very much foe not friend, and Flintoff struggling with the demands of captaincy, England were blown away.
""When Australia were looking at what had gone wrong in 2005 one of the things they put it down to was Warne's relationship with me and they said that had to change,"" says Pietersen, 33.
""He threw the ball twice at me in Brisbane and our discussions got really, really personal in the middle. Off the field he called me Kevin, not KP or PK. It had totally changed.""
Despite the provocation from Warne, Pietersen enjoyed a prolific series with the bat, averaging more than 54. His reaction to the defeat, however, hinted at the friction with his team-mates that flared up so spectacularly last year.
""I was extremely disappointed - I didn't deal with it the right way,"" he admits.
""I don't think I related to it in Australia - because I got 500 runs and I was thinking 'why did we get smashed?' I don't think that went down well with some people.""
In one of the most introspective sections of the interview, Pietersen explains that he learnt to deal with the failings of his team-mates when he was going through a bad patch of his own in 2010.
""Until you go through the depths of despair as a sportsman you don't understand the good stuff or the bad stuff,"" he says.
""The hardest time was on a Bangladesh tour in 2010. I didn't know which end of the bat to hold. I just couldn't hit the ball and I ended up sitting on a bus and thinking 'where is my career going to go?'""
Fortunately for England, a spell in South Africa with his mentor Graham Ford soon put things right and set Pietersen up for one of the most prolific periods of his career.
There was a double-hundred in Adelaide in England's 3-1 Ashes triumph in 2010-11, another at Lord's in the 4-0 whitewash of India in 2011, and four more hundreds before a knee injury sidelined him in March.
They included the defiant 149 against South Africa at Headingley last year, before the discovery of his ""provocative"" text messages to the opposition dressing room saw him dropped for the final Test at Lord's, and the brilliant 186 against India in Mumbai that confirmed his ""reintegration"" into the England side.
That century was Pietersen's 22nd in Tests, briefly taking him alongside Wally Hammond, Colin Cowdrey, Geoffrey Boycott and current captain Alastair Cook at the top of England's all-time list.
Pietersen describes the less extravagant but more consistent Cook - who has since taken his own tally of tons to 25 - as ""such a nice guy"" who will go down as ""one of the greatest cricketers in terms of statistics to have ever played the game"".
As for his own legacy, in a closing passage to the interview tinged with regret, he concedes that his tendency towards showmanship may leave him short of his ultimate ambitions.
""I've always said I just want to get the best out of my talent and when I've finished my career I just want to say I've done the best that I possibly could,"" he explains.
""But I know that because of the way I play I'm not going to have done the best I could because I get myself out for 20, 40, 60 or 70 all the time. That will be the man on the shoulder that says I think you've done OK, but…""

28824975,"Pro-democracy activists have staged huge protests, the most recent on the 1 July anniversary of the day Hong Kong was handed back to China from Britain.
They have threatened to occupy parts of the city if their demands are not met.
Public discontent in Hong Kong is at its highest for years with concern over Beijing's influence over elections.
The city's police estimated Sunday's turnout at more than 110,000 people, but a specialist polling group based at the University of Hong Kong put the figure at around 80,000.
""We want to let the world know that we want peace, we want democracy, but please, do not threaten us, do not try to turn this place into a place of violence,"" Robert Chow, co-founder of the pro-government Alliance for Peace and Democracy told AFP.
Political rallies are a common sight in Hong Kong, a special Chinese city with a high level of freedom.
But large-scale demonstrations supportive of the Chinese government in Beijing are extremely rare.
The demonstrators -- much older than their pro-democracy rivals and clearly mobilised by dozens of pro-China clan organisations -- carried signs opposing the civil disobedience movement called Occupy Central.
Questions have been raised about the legitimacy of the demonstration.
Hong Kong media reports have suggested some companies and business groups had asked their employees to take part.
Despite those controversies, Johnson Yeung, a pro-democracy activist who organised the recent 1 July protest, told BBC News the rally was indeed an historic event.
""For the first time since the handover in 1997, the central government has organised a mass rally of this scale. It really shows their commitment against Occupy Central.""
The large turnout is a reminder there is still no consensus in the battle for Hong Kong's political future.
In the other camp, pro-democracy activists from the ""Occupy Central"" group have said they would mobilise protesters to take over some of the busier areas of the central business district if electoral reform is not put in place.
City authorities say such an occupation would be illegal however, and argue that it could tarnish Hong Kong's reputation.
Hong Kong's next elections will take place in 2017, and China says it will introduce universal suffrage for the vote.
However the current Chief Executive of Hong Kong CY Leung was elected by a committee largely loyal to the Chinese government.
The pro-democracy protesters fear that the shortlist of candidates to replace him will be a similar group also loyal to Beijing.
The chief executive is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee. A majority of the representatives are viewed as pro-Beijing.
The Chinese government has promised direct elections for the leader, known as the chief executive, by 2017.
However, voters will only have a choice from a list of candidates selected by a nominating committee, and Beijing has said all candidates must be ""patriotic"".
Activists fear China will use the committee to screen out candidates it disapproves of.","A major pro-government rally in Hong Kong is drawing in thousands of supporters, in response to civil disobedience campaigns by activists."

Penzance are bottom of the South West Peninsula League Division One West, the 11th tier of English football.
""The club contacted me through Twitter asking if I could help out,"" Haigh said. ""I'd had one or two offers since Leeds, and I said no to them.
""But, the reason why I said yes to Penzance is because of the potential. They're at the bottom, so they can only go up.

After leaving Leeds, Haigh moved to Dubai where he was acquitted in March over charges of sending an offensive tweet about a business partner.
But, he served a two-year sentence on separate charges of financial misappropriation.
Haigh, who grew up in Cornwall and has relocated to the county since leaving Dubai, will be sponsoring Penzance rather than financially backing them.

""I want the fight and it shouldn't be too difficult to make.""
Selby said any possible meeting could be held in Belfast or Cardiff's Principality Stadium.
Barry-born Selby insisted before the fight there was no chance of him meeting British rival Josh Warrington, who beat Patrick Hyland to retain his WBC International featherweight title.
Selby accused Warrington of 'running scared,' after talks fell through over arranging a summer contest at Leeds' Elland Road.
Frampton inflicted the first defeat of 27-year-old Mexican Santa Cruz's career to become the first Northern Ireland fighter to win a world title in two weight divisions.
It was Frampton's first pro bout at featherweight, having moved up a division after unifying the IBF and WBA super-bantamweight titles by beating England's Scott Quigg in Manchester in February.
Selby said he was not surprised by Frampton's majority verdict over Santa Cruz, who has held world titles at three weights.
""I thought it was a brilliant fight and very competitive from the first bell to the last,"" Selby added.
""Carl Frampton boxed excellent and he surprised me with his tactics. I thought he would box on the back foot and use his range and jab.
""But at times he held his feet, stood in the middle of the ring and went toe to toe and beat Santa Cruz at his own game.""",IBF world champion Lee Selby is confident his next fight will be against new WBA world featherweight champion Carl Frampton.

He died on Tuesday surrounded by his family in hospital, his publicist said.
His wife Camilla said she was ""deeply grateful"" to staff who cared for him.
The father-of-three, who was in intensive care at Cork University Hospital, ""died peacefully"" with his family at his side ""who were singing him on his way"", a statement said.
""Colin received the best possible care from the expert and highly professional staff there and we are deeply grateful for everything they did,"" his wife and three sons said in a statement.
Fellow Liverpool musician Pete Wylie of 80s band The Mighty Wah! paid tribute to his friend on Twitter, saying the news was ""just so very sad"".
""I want to send all the love I can muster to Colin's parents, brother & partner + to all who loved him, and who he loved too,"" he wrote.
""I could still sing the very first song Colin recorded with me in the WAH! studio. I remember it that clearly. And that voice!""
Born in Liverpool in 1962, Vearncombe had his first top 10 hit with the single Sweetest Smile in June 1987 when he was 25 years old.
His second hit song Wonderful Life, which he had previously released but only got to number 72 in the charts, made the top 10 in the UK, Switzerland, Germany, France, Austria, the Netherlands and Italy.
However, despite having found fame, Vearncombe later said ""the pop star life"" was not as he had imagined it.
""I was frustrated by how few of the people in the music world I respected. Maybe I just didn't go to the right clubs. I've never been a great schmoozer or networker and the idea of setting out to meet a certain type of people is anathema to me,"" he said.
""It was two years of disappointment - I didn't have any wild sex, I'm not a druggie, so I was just digging a hole for myself.""
Wonderful Life has since been used in numerous advertisements and films, and has been covered by artists including Tina Cousins and  Katie Melua.
The album of the same name sold more than 1.5 million copies and peaked at number three.
Although he is best known for Wonderful Life and another 1980s single Sweetest Smile, Vearncombe released 15 albums under his own name.
Last year, he returned to his original stage name for a crowd-funded album, Blind Faith, which received positive reviews.
He has also published poetry and staged exhibitions of his paintings in south-west Ireland, where he lived in later life.

37860227,"It said the investigation following complaints from price comparison websites had failed to understand the ""reality"" of online shopping.
It blamed a drop in traffic for price comparison sites on Amazon and others.
Europe's competition commissioner first accused the firm of abusing its dominance in search in April 2015 and made further claims in July 2016.
Google's shopping results appear as a box of images and links displayed alongside other search results.
In 2015, the EU competition commissioner claimed these results gave prominence to Google's own services and advertisements, to the detriment of price comparison websites, which may have lost visitors.
Google responded that the EU had failed to take into account the significance of online shopping giants such as Amazon, which it said also competed against price comparison websites.
In its updated claim, the EU said Amazon could not be considered a rival to price comparison websites because it sometimes paid such sites to be included in search results.
Google's latest response says websites such as Amazon get a ""tiny fraction"" of their visitors from price comparison websites, ""hardly enough to support the idea that they don't compete"" with one another.
It also pointed out that Amazon provides its own price comparison tools for its customers.
""The commission's revised case still rests on a theory that just doesn't fit the reality of how most people shop online,"" the company said in a blog.
""It's not surprising that when Amazon and other new competitors arrived in European countries, traffic to sites offering only price comparison went down.""
The company said it would ""look forward"" to continuing discussions with the commission.
FairSearch Europe - a lobby group that was one of the complainants against Google - said Google's actions were ""anti-consumer"".
In a statement, the group said: ""We believe it is the European Commission that has the interests of consumers in mind, not a private company that makes money by using its market power to charge high prices to advertisers.
""When consumers look at Google ads they do not get the best, most relevant results. Instead, they get results from advertisers willing to pay Google the most money.""",Google has again rejected the EU's objections to how it displays shopping links in its search results.

38915466,"With the windows down, I sang along to cheesy Mediterranean songs on the radio, watching the scenery flash by.
But I was there to make a documentary about Europe dancing to a worrying tune - popular discontent, fear, anger and, in many corners, an absence of hope.
There is always a section in society that feels abandoned or ignored by their government, but after the 2008 crash, the bank bailouts, the migrant crises and a string of terror attacks, a growing number of Europeans have felt unprotected, exposed and worried for the future of their families.
And the answer to their fears? Well if my Fiat 500 were Europe - bear with me on this one - it would be hesitating at a crossroads.
The signpost pointing one way reads Angela Merkel. And in the opposite direction, Marine Le Pen.
These two determined women, tough and seasoned politicians, both standing for election this year, hope to drag their own countries and Europe as a whole down dramatically different paths.
A passionate European and Christian Democrat, mindful of the horrors of her country's Nazi and Cold War past, Ms Merkel is increasingly viewed as the continent's number one defender of liberal values. Barack Obama pointedly chose to visit her in Berlin on his last official trip abroad before handing over the presidency to Donald Trump.
Ms Le Pen, on the other hand, is the poster child of Europe's new wave of populism. She demands what she described to me in an interview as a ""new world order"". A new France, a new Europe, free, she says, of the ""prison"" of the European Union and the ""artificial"" joining of European nations.
She laughed at those wringing their hands on both sides of the Atlantic over the Trump Presidency.
Brexit, Trump and Europe's new ""patriotic leaders"" in Ms Le Pen's words, are merely the end of one world and the start of a new one where, in her opinion, the people and the nation state are strong and don't answer to what she called ""Globalisationists"".
Gone are the days in the not so distant past when national elections met a wall of public indifference - 2017 has been dubbed 'Election Year' in Europe, with key EU nations Germany, France, the Netherlands and possibly Italy heading to the polls.
With populist parties standing strong, those for and against them feel motivated to vote. And not just with their pockets in mind. The famous campaign slogan, ""it's the economy, stupid"", associated with Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential bid, is no longer pertinent.
Look at the Netherlands - holding an election next month. The economy there is on the up and unemployment is down. But rather than flocking around their centrist prime minister, voters are flirting with anti-immigration, Eurosceptic populist, Geert Wilders.
Wherever you look at the moment in Europe - north, south, east and west - there are populist parties shouting loudly from the sidelines.
The Five Star Movement is Italy's most talked-about political party right now. They listen to people, they say, not Big Business, and their message is captivating the country's disenchanted, from all ages and backgrounds.
""Populism is a beautiful world,"" Beppe Grillo, the figurehead of the movement, told me. ""I am proud to be a populist. It means we are saying No! No! and No! and we will win the next election.""
A nostalgic nationalist, anti-immigration, vein runs through most of Europe's populist parties but their policies vary from country to country. It is incorrect to describe them all as ""far right"".
Even the parties which have deep roots in the extreme right, such as Austria's Freedom Party or Ms Le Pen's Front National, have tried to broaden their appeal, declaring they are of the people, not right or left.
""Au nom du peuple"" (in the name of the people) is the banner under which Ms Le Pen is running her presidential campaign in France.
And after the Francois Fillon fiasco in France, with the centre-right's presidential candidate damaged by corruption allegations, Ms Le Pen has a chance of making it to her country's highest political office.

Next month is the EU's 60th birthday, with lavish celebrations planned in Rome. But outside the birthday party gates the EU's existence is being seriously questioned.
And there is a global significance to all this too. Europe's populists are for the most part big fans of Presidents Putin and Trump, and a weak, fractured Europe works for both men.
With many Europeans nervous about the Trump presidency and with so much at stake, it could be that even angry voters feel safer sticking with the political mainstream this year.
But predict at your peril. Polls have proved unreliable. Europe's voters are in a volatile mood.

32397755,"The state oil firm's technicians discovered one of the world's largest oil reserves deep beneath the seabed - under miles of layers of salt.
And then two years later, it struck gold again, finding yet another giant oil reserve.
Optimism was running high. The firm went to the markets and raised over $70bn - the world's largest share issue ever.
Brazil's economy was at cruising speed too, finally taking off after years of meagre growth.
But the good times did not last long - for neither the company nor the country. A massive corruption scandal last year eroded much of Petrobras's market value.
Brazil's economy too has been on a downward spiral - with high inflation, slow growth and low confidence.
So how did it all go so wrong, so fast?
Petrobras's oil bonanza and Brazil's emerging star status are fairly recent phenomena.
Just a few decades ago, prospects were dire for both.
In the early 1990s, Brazil was a young democracy in deep economic trouble.
Annualised inflation was running close to 5,000%. Decades of protectionism meant there was little competition in most sectors and many national firms had become inefficient.
Petrobras was seen as part of that landscape by many who wanted to privatise it.
One critic used to refer to it as ""Petrossauro"" - a large, outdated structure that moved slowly and was doomed to extinction in the modern world.
Brazil's fortunes started to change in the mid-1990s - both internally and externally.
Through reforms, successive governments were able to defeat hyperinflation, open up Brazil's economy to the world and redistribute growth, lifting millions out of poverty.
A decade of global economic boom favoured Brazil's champion exports - commodities like coffee, soya, beef and oil.
Brazil's oil sector was opened to foreign companies, but local laws made sure Petrobras kept its role at the top of every major project.
A decade of high international oil prices helped give a great boost to the firm's investment plans.
By 2010 - after all oil discoveries - it felt like Brazil and Petrobras had finally ""arrived"" at the top.
But then things took a turn for the worse.
One problem was Petrobras's desperate need for cash.
Brazil's treasure trove is buried deep below the pre-salt layer and can only be extracted with expensive methods.
President Dilma Rousseff was adamant that Petrobras should play a major role in all fields, although it did not have the resources to do it alone.
So the company sought to attract partners and raise money abroad by selling many of its assets.
Just as it was taking on its biggest financial challenge ever, Petrobras was hit by a recurrent obstacle in Brazil's history: corruption.
An investigation by Brazil's Federal Police revealed that the state oil giant was being used illegally as a cash cow for most parties in the government coalition.
Its top executives are all politically appointed by the government.
They allegedly handed out Petrobras contracts in exchange for party donations and bribes.
A string of high-profile arrests were made - from top Brazilian CEOs to the treasurer of Rousseff's ruling party.
More than 40 key politicians are under investigation, including the presidents of both houses of Congress.
Confidence in the company eroded almost overnight - both in the markets and in the streets.
Its own CEO was sacked for not being able to handle the crisis.
Tens of thousands of Brazilians took to the streets against President Rousseff - who chaired the board of Petrobras for much of the period when the alleged bribes happened.
It could not have come at a worse time for Brazil's economy.
It is stuck in low gear, now that the commodity boom seems to be over, and its goods are no longer in high demand.
Until last year, the government had been trying to navigate through the crisis by raising spending and pumping money into the economy.
The pre-salt layer is made up of rock that was laid down millions of years ago before a layer of salt - which can be thousands of metres thick - accumulated above it.
Some of the oil formed in the pre-salt layer has not leaked up into the layers above.
This oil is often of good quality, but is buried so deep that access to it is difficult.
According to Petrobras, there may be 50 billion barrels of oil in the pre-salt layer found in the Brazilian continental shelf.
Petrobras itself was used as an instrument of that policy.
The state oil firm controls the internal price of fuel, and for three years it helped Brazilians get cheaper petrol.
But the subsidies hurt the company at a time when it needed all the cash it could get for its pre-salt project.
Now the government has done a u-turn in its policy, going radically from stimulus to austerity.
In the past, Petrobras has helped the government get through downturns, as its investments alone represent 2% of Brazilian Gross National Product.
But now it is making matters even worse.
One study by FGV Business School suggests the fall of Petrobras investment could knock about $30bn off the Brazilian economy, with more than a million jobs lost, mostly in construction.
Petrobras and Brazil have been trying to react to the crisis with a push for transparency.
Later this month, it will replace some politicians in its board of directors with respected market figures, like the president of mining giant Vale, Murilo Ferreira.
The energy minister has even signalled that the government might ease access to pre-salt projects for foreign firms, reducing the burden on Petrobras.
Some say Brazil has learned some lessons.
""If you concentrate everything - all wealth - in a single company controlled by the state then it is very easy for the political system to go there and try to grab resources,"", says Sergio Lazzarini, an academic at Insper Business School.
""You can avoid this with more competition, more transparency, more regulation.""
Brazil and Petrobras still have a difficult path to follow.
Most economists predict Brazil will be in recession this year.
And the corruption scandal is far from over, as no-one has been tried yet.
President Rousseff insists Brazil and Petrobras will be stronger after this crisis, as historic corruption is finally being investigated after decades of omission.
Brazilians hope she is right, but the mood in the country is bleak.
After decades of low expectations, Brazilians had come to think in recent years that the nation was finally emerging into the world stage as a global power, only to see it again stuck with corruption and low growth.
While many still recognise the country is much better off than in the years of hyperinflation and ""Petrossauro"", optimism has now been largely replaced by scepticism and impatience.
Brazil's treasure trove, it seems, will take a while longer to dig out.","In 2008, Petrobras and its main stakeholder - the government of Brazil - hit the jackpot."

Those charges have now been dropped.
A spokeswoman for the district attorney in New York's Queen's district told US media the case would be dismissed because of insufficient evidence.
Mr LaBeouf's art project, a 24-hour live stream called He Will Not Divide Us, encouraged members of the public to say those words into a camera outside New York's Museum of the Moving Image.
But Mr LaBeouf and a member of the public allegedly entered an altercation during a live broadcast in January.  The museum later said the site had become ""a flashpoint for violence"".

He now faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.
In a statement, the Secret Service said it was ""extremely disappointed and angry"" about the events of 10 March.
Mr Tran did not gain entry to the White House, where President Donald Trump was staying at the time.
However, Congressman Jason Chaffetz - whose House Oversight Committee oversees the Secret Service - claimed the intruder had managed to rattle a door-handle at the South Portico entrance.
According to court documents, Mr Tran told federal agents that he was a friend of the president and had an appointment.
He was carrying two cans of mace, a US passport, a computer and one of Mr Trump's books, authorities said.
The president praised the Secret Service for doing a ""fantastic job"" in apprehending the intruder.
Mr Tran had managed to climb a 5ft (1.5m) fence near the US Treasury Department, which is next to the White House. He then scaled an 8ft vehicle gate, and a shorter fence near the east wing of the White House grounds.
CNN reports that he set off several alarms after jumping the fence, but was able to avoid other sensors.
Mr Tran, who comes from Milpitas, California, had reportedly been spotted ""looming around"" Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue, where the White House stands, nearly six hours before his arrest.
The Secret Service said it had taken immediate steps to avoid further security lapses, and that over 50 people had been interviewed about the incident.

The two Britons led from the front as the challengers were gradually whittled down, before Stimpson used her greater power to pull away in the final kilometre of the 10km run.

32031233,"The Xylella fastidiosa bacteria also threatens citrus fruit and vineyards.
The Commission says at least 10% of the 11 million olive trees in Lecce are infected. It wants Italy to destroy infected trees and restrict any trade in species vulnerable to the disease.
New emergency measures are to be proposed by the Commission this week.
Thousands of hectares of olives are affected by the outbreak - a major worry for Italy, which is the EU's second biggest olive oil producer after Spain.
The Commission set out a range of measures to contain the outbreak last July, but says the situation has deteriorated since then and more action is needed.
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) says the disease, which kills trees by desiccation, is spread by various sap-sucking insects.
An EFSA spokesperson told the BBC that there remain ""a lot of uncertainties"" about the Italian outbreak, despite a comprehensive EFSA study of it published in January.
""Even trees not showing symptoms might carry the bacteria, which makes it really difficult. Just cutting down trees with symptoms might not be enough,"" he said.
Italian officials in Lecce say 15km-wide (nine-mile) buffer strips will be created around plantations which have infected trees. Those strips should be free of species vulnerable to the disease, so that the blight is contained.
Local officials, quoted by Italy's AGI news agency, suspect the disease entered Italy through ornamental plants imported from Costa Rica.
The Xylella blight has previously ravaged vineyards in California and citrus groves in Brazil, EFSA says.
A local campaign group called Peacelink disputes the EU data on the disease, however, arguing that a fungal infection is most likely to blame.
In a letter to EU Health and Food Safety Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis, Peacelink says more than 500 olive trees treated for fungi have recovered since spring last year.
It says research by the University of Foggia pointed to fungi, rather than Xylella, as the cause.
Peacelink urged the EU not to destroy olive trees en masse in the affected area, saying such a move would be ""totally unnecessary"".","Italy must step up efforts to contain a bacterial disease blighting olive trees in the southern province of Lecce, the European Commission has warned."
32229825,"It said its food and funerals business had performed ""robustly"", with same-store sales in food up 0.4%, but its insurance business had lost money.
The Co-op has begun a three-year plan to steady the business after deep problems emerged in 2013 with its bank, which it has since largely sold off.
In 2014, it made a net profit of £216m selling its pharmacy chain and farms.
Chief executive Richard Pennycock said without the proceeds of the sales the group would have, ""at best, broken even"".
He said the organisation had made good progress reducing its costs, which had fallen from £176m to £146m and it had also cut its debts from £1.4bn to £808m.
Co-op Group chairman Allan Leighton told the BBC that the business had strayed a long way: 'We lost the heart of what the Co-op was. I mean look at what's happened to the business, it's terrible.

The Co-op is the country's largest mutually-owned organisation with more than eight million members, who share in the profits of the business.
It is the UK's fifth-largest food retailer with almost 2,800 stores. In the last year, the group added 82 convenience stores and refurbished more than 700 stores. It plans to expand by adding another 100 outlets this year.
But despite the improving performance, the business warned it would not be paying a dividend to its members until 2018.
Last year, the Co-op recorded a net loss of £2.3bn, once one-off losses relating to its bank and its then-owned Somerfield business were taken into account.
It was forced to divest itself of a large chunk of the bank to a number of private investors, largely hedge funds, and now owns just 20% of that business.
That prompted a review by Lord Myners in which he called the group ""manifestly dysfunctional"" and recommended a major shake-up in its organisational structure.
Co-op members will also get the chance to vote on whether the group should continue to make donations to political parties.

40165953,"At Warwick Crown Court her barrister accused the prosecution of launching a ""tabloid attack"" against her.
Mrs Wadsworth and her husband Tony are on trial accused of indecently assaulting seven boys in the 1990s.
The couple deny the offences and charges of outraging public decency.
Mrs Wadsworth's barrister, David Hislop QC, criticised the prosecutions use of a ""Naughty but Nice"" charity calendar, in which Mrs Wadsworth posed as Lady Godiva, to suggest her career was forged ""on the twang of a stocking"".
He suggested the prosecution used the calendar because of ""shortcomings in their evidence"".
Mr Hislop claimed that prejudice and emotion had infected the investigation into allegations against the couple who previously worked for BBC Leicester and Birmingham-based BBC WM.
He stressed to the jury that Mrs Wadsworth was not on trial to assess her morals.
She accepts having sexual encounters with ""young men"" but denies they were underage.
The couple, from Broughton Astley in Leicestershire, are charged with five counts of outraging public decency alleging they engaged in sexual activity ""against a tree"" in woodland in Warwickshire in view of others between July 1992 and June 1996. They deny the charges.
Mrs Wadsworth has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of indecent assault, while her husband denies nine counts of the same offence.
The trial continues.","Former BBC presenter Julie Wadsworth, accused of sex offences against under-age boys, is the victim of ""poisonous and untrue"" allegations, her defence claims."

Det Supt Atkinson said: ""One undetected murder is one too many.
""That is why the PCC has announced these extra resources to recruit staff to review all these cases and we are determined to do our best to get some answers, to find the people responsible and to bring them to justice.""

32180018,"Glenn Murray put the Eagles ahead when he headed in from close range after Bolasie's deflected cross.
Bolasie added a second soon afterwards as he poked the ball past Costel Pantilimon after Murray's knockdown.
A lofted finish from Bolasie made it 3-0 and he completed his treble from Murray's pass before Connor Wickham volleyed in a late consolation.
The result, the second time in three home games that Sunderland have conceded four goals, increases the Black Cats' relegation fears.

They have been in the Premier League for eight successive seasons but are now 16th in the table, only three points above QPR and Burnley.
Sunderland have only six games left to save themselves, but their last two matches of the season are away at Arsenal and then at current leaders Chelsea.
Dick Advocaat, brought in after former manager Gus Poyet had been sacked following a 4-0 home defeat by Aston Villa, had stressed the importance of this match to his side.
But he was let down by some woeful defending as the hosts capitulated and conceded four goals in a 14-minute spell early in the second half.
After a quiet first half that was low on quality and goalscoring chances, but high on fierce challenges, the match sprung into life within three minutes of the restart.
Murray headed in his sixth goal in six games to set Palace on their way to their eighth win in 12 Premier League games since Alan Pardew took over at the start of the January.
But even he could not have expected what was to follow.
The hosts fell apart and three minutes later Bolasie, with one goal in his previous 27 league matches this season, got to Murray's flick-on first to make it 2-0.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The third goal was a poor one to concede, although Bolasie showed great technique to lift the ball over advancing Sunderland goalkeeper Pantilimon.
Sunderland, who had beaten Newcastle 1-0 in their last match, fell further behind as Murray again linked up with Bolasie and he scored at the second attempt after being initially denied by Pantilimon.
Advocaat had named what looked an attacking line-up with Jermain Defoe, Steven Fletcher and Wickham named in a three-man forward-line, although it took the hosts 44 minutes to record a shot on target.
In front of a near-empty home support, who left the ground en masse after Palace's fourth goal, Wickham did well to steer the ball into the net in the 90th minute after Patrick van Aanholt's pullback.
But it could not take the shine off Palace's day as they boosted their hopes of finishing in the top half of the Premier League for the first time ever.
However, for Sunderland it was another dark day at the Stadium of Light.
Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat said:
""We have to recover in 14 days with an away game against Stoke and we have to do better as this was not good enough.
""After the Newcastle game we did not see this performance coming. We had trained really well and the confidence had come back. We gave the match away in the first 10 minutes of the second half.
""We could not cope with their pace, but I don't want to complain about the players. We win as a team and lose as a team.
""We still have six matches left and it's in our hands. You cannot lose 4-1 to Crystal Palace in a home game because we need to get results.""",Yannick Bolasie's 11-minute hat-trick helped Crystal Palace humiliate relegation-threatened Sunderland.

Morgan says that heavy loss was like ""men against boys"", with New Zealand going on to reach the final.
""It's completely different now, two years down the line,"" said Morgan.
England recovered later that year to beat Brendon McCullum's tourists 3-2.
Another victory in Tuesday's match, which starts at 10:30 BST, would put them into the Champions Trophy last four, after New Zealand's game with Australia on Friday was abandoned because of rain.
""We've got a completely new team, pretty much,"" added Morgan.
""A lot of it has to do with confidence. We come into this tournament full of confidence.
""The dominant factor in New Zealand was that they had that confidence, whereas we didn't.""
Morgan's side face Australia at Edgbaston on Saturday in their final Group A game.
Steve Finn has replaced injured all-rounder Chris Woakes in the squad and Morgan says the Middlesex seamer was an automatic choice.
""It was backing up consistency in selection and trying to get guys together as a group that we've showed trust in over the last couple of years,"" he said.
""We've tried to go like-for-like as often as we can. But when we can't, we go for a guy we can throw the ball to at any stage in order to try to make an impact in the game.
""Finny is one of those guys, and I'd have no hesitation in playing him if we felt it was the right thing to do.""",England captain Eoin Morgan says his side have the confidence to beat New Zealand in Cardiff on Tuesday and reach the Champions Trophy semi-finals.

City said the delay would have ""very little impact"".
In a statement, it added: ""Although some may be slightly frustrated that the club will not be in a position to move into the new stadium for the start of the 2016/17 season, ensuring the future development is built correctly is crucial in providing a fantastic new home for York City for decades to come.""

The council also plans to scrap engines in Ponteland, Seahouses and Wooler and replace them with smaller appliances.
It has to save £500,000 on top of £1.5m cuts and has just finished a three-month consultation on its proposals.
The authority said a number of concerns had been raised, including how the county would cope in the face of further flooding when fire crews are called to help.

Richard Wayman, chief operating officer for the BHA, said: ""Although there has been growth in total prize money in recent years, much of this has been at the top end. The returns to our sport's participants further down the scale are simply not sufficient at present to be sustainable.
""Targeting grassroots with extra funding will help racing's participants to maintain their involvement in the sport, keeping more horses in training, as well as helping with the recruitment and retention of staff to care for our horses.""
The BHA proposes to invest additional levy income in racing from 2018, with the aim of delivering three key objectives for the sport - supporting ownership, delivering more competitive and compelling racing, and increasing customer engagement.
A statement by the BHA proposed that, in addition to the increased number on meetings next year, there will also be ""customer-friendly slots on Friday evenings and Saturday afternoons throughout summer with the aim of increasing attendances"".
""We need the fixture list and race programme to work in a manner that meets our customer's requirements.

Unionists had said the issue of continued paramilitary activity was crucial to their involvement.

""Policing and security in Northern Ireland is not just the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive, the secretary of state has a particular responsibility as well,"" Mr Robinson said.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) became operational in Northern Ireland in May.
Given its wide-ranging remit and resources, it would be reasonable to assume it knows the extent of paramilitary involvement in organised crime in Northern Ireland.
It should be in a position to provide an assessment of paramilitary involvement to the Northern Ireland Secretary and political parties.
So, it seems unlikely that the review to be published by the independent panel in October will tell Theresa Villiers and political parties anything they could not be told today by the NCA and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

He said ""permanent and statutory steps"" to address paramilitary activity and links should be determined within the talks process.
The Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt described Ms Villiers statement as a ""positive step forward"".
Ms Villiers said the assessment of paramilitaries would be carried out by UK security agencies and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and would be reviewed and checked by three people whose names would be announced early next week.
""I also intend to establish dedicated funding aimed at increasing the capability of agencies working to tackle criminality and organised crime associated with paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland,"" she said.
""It will support agencies to enhance specialist capabilities such as forensic accounting to strengthen their capacity to seize criminal assets.

More than 4,000 people have so far donated to the fundraising page, posted at 10:30 GMT on Wednesday, including music stars Craig David and Ellie Goulding.
In a Facebook post, Mr Gilbert said the response was "" truly humbling"".
""I can't begin to express our gratitude - not a penny is being taken for granted and we've been moved to tears many times over the last few days reading the supportive messages from not only friends and family but also strangers from all over the world.""
Ms Heale said she and Mr Gilbert had been ""in tears and holding hands"" as they watched the pledges come in.
She said: ""It's been overwhelming; our phone has been ringing off the hook. I was refreshing the page this morning and were just like, 'oh my God, we've done it'.
""Grateful doesn't cover it. We've had one person donate £2,000. After such a difficult year for people, to have this at Christmas is so hopeful for us.""
Ms Heale said she was researching options for treatment, including personalised immunotherapy in Germany and the USA.
She said she was considering posting a new fundraising target of £250,000, after a private specialist warned that Mr Gilbert's medical bills could amount to £100,000 a year.

38937299,"Although ratification in national parliaments will be needed before its total application, approval of the deal would be an important symbolic moment.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is due to speak to MEPs on Thursday, the day after the ratification vote.
The speech will be the first made to a full meeting of the Parliament by a Canadian PM.
New Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen will also make his first address to MEPs on Tuesday.
As well as that, MEPs are due to vote on new legislation relating to border checks and terrorist offences.
They will also vote on a motion setting out their position on where the EU should go after Brexit.
Here are the main events coming up in the week ahead...
The sitting will kick off in the afternoon with a debate on ways to promote greater use of natural pesticides in European farming.
In a motion on Wednesday, MEPs are likely to call for current EU authorisation rules for such pesticides to be eased.
The day's main debate is on suggestions for improving the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS), a scheme which aims to reduce carbon emissions.
The scheme works by making large power plants buy ""allowances"" authorising them to emit greenhouse gases, within an overall agreed limit.
Critics of the system say it is ineffective because the price of permits is too low and the overall cap has become overly generous due to lower economic activity.
The EU Commission has proposed to increase the speed at which emissions permits are withdrawn from the market in the nine years running up to 2030.
MEPs will take a position on the changes on Wednesday, although the necessary agreement from EU governments on where to go from here has not yet been found.
In the evening, they will debate non-binding reports in a number of areas, including one on the EU's competition policy.
They will also debate a draft motion which calls for whistleblowers to gain greater protection in EU law.
The day begins with a debate on three separate motions on the future of the treaties and powers of the EU.
These non-binding reports will set out the Parliament's position on the bloc's future ahead of next month's events to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.
The most notable is the one drafted by the assembly's Brexit observer Guy Verhofstadt, which calls for a ""comprehensive"" review of the EU's current treaties.
Among the many recommendations endorsed at committee stage was a call for the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency - both currently based in London - to be moved out of the UK after Brexit.
The three motions - along with amendments - will be put to a vote on Thursday.
At lunchtime, MEPs will decide whether to support an agreement to allow Europol to conclude data-sharing powers with Denmark after it quits the body.
Denmark is due to leave the EU police co-operation agency in May, when it is due to acquire a raft of new powers.
Continued membership would have required Denmark to end opt-outs on certain EU legislation - something Danish voters rejected in a 2015 referendum.
A new agreement would allow for some information-sharing to continue, and give the country observer status in the organisation.
MEPs do not have the power to block an agreement, but have to give their opinion before it can be put into place.
In the afternoon, they will discuss the continued wrangling over the IMF's participation in the latest stage of Greece's EU bailout.
Eurozone ministers are under pressure to break the deadlock next week, the last time they will meet before forthcoming elections in the Netherlands.
MEPs will also debate the recent upsurge in violence in eastern Ukraine and the recent passing of an Israeli law legalising almost 4,000 settler homes.
As well as assessing the EU membership aspirations of Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the evening they will also debate suggestions for changing the process by which the EU monitors the budgets and spending of member states.
The entire morning sitting will be taken up by debate on CETA, the EU-Canada trade deal that faces a ratification vote just after 11.00 GMT.
Ratification would allow the agreement to provisionally come into force from as soon as next month.
Sections of the deal covering investment protection and financial services will come into force once the deal has been ratified by national parliaments.
The deal aims to eliminate 98% of tariffs on goods traded between Canada and the EU, making it the EU's most comprehensive trade deal to date.
The agreement also includes provisions allowing companies greater access to public sector contracts, and sustainable development clauses.
Green, left-wing and Eurosceptic MEPs have vowed to vote against, although it passed fairly comfortably in the lead international trade committee.
Eyes will be on the centre-left Socialist and Democrats group, whose MEPs may split on the issue.
After the lunchtime voting session, the afternoon will begin with a debate on proposals to extend the list of terror-related offenses made illegal in EU law.
New legislation will make travelling for terrorist purposes, terrorist training and funding terrorist activities illegal under EU legislation.
A compromise on the changes has been reached with national ministers and will be put to a final vote on Thursday.
EU states will have 18 months to incorporate the changes into domestic legislation - the UK, Ireland and Denmark will not have to apply them.
After this they will debate proposals to increase checks at the external border of the passport-free Schengen area.
The new law would require travellers to be checked against Interpol's stolen and lost travel documents database (SLTD) and the Schengen Information System.
The new requirements will also be put to a vote on Thursday.
In the evening, MEPs will debate a report from the legal affairs committee which calls for new EU legislation in the field of robotics.
The committee's suggestions are not binding on the EU Commission, which would have to propose any new laws in this area.
Among its many recommendations, the draft report suggests creating a new EU agency to register advanced robots and give advice to national regulators.
After a debate on the EU's 2015 strategy for the civil aviation sector, MEPs will debate their usual three motions on human rights cases.
This month's picks relate to Nicaragua, executions in Kuwait and Bahrain and activists in Guatemala.
After the expected ratification of the CETA deal the day before, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is due to speak from 10.00 GMT.
The reports on robotics and the future direction of the EU, as well as the legislation on border checks and terror offences, will be voted on after that.
The afternoon's only short debate will see MEPs debate the Commission's recent agreement with Germany on its planned road tolls.
In 2015 the German Parliament approved a law that allowed German-registered cars to get a deduction on the charge on their annual vehicle tax bill.
MEPs have tabled an oral question questioning whether the EU executive was right to suspend its anti-discrimination court case given the scale of the amendments to the plan agreed with Berlin.
Please note: This agenda is subject to modification at the opening of the session on Monday afternoon.
A guide to how the European Parliament's plenary sessions can be found here.","After seven years of talks, MEPs will finally decide whether to ratify the EU's trade deal with Canada during their plenary sitting in Strasbourg this week."

Dunfermline, having played a game more, top Group B after a 9-8 penalty shootout win over East Fife following a goalless draw.
The shootout victory meant the Pars picked up two points with East Fife taking one.
After 17 penalties without a miss, Ben Gordon was the unlucky man to fail with his spot-kick.
Hearts head coach Cathro was happy to see summer signing Lafferty open his account for the club.
""We anticipated it would be difficult, it's not an easy place to come and play,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""They defended well and we had to be patient.
""I'm pleased that we stayed calm and that Kyle (Lafferty) got a goal. It was a good finish.""
In Group A, Inverness Caledonian Thistle held on to top spot despite needing a shootout following a 0-0 draw away to Stirling Albion.
Liam Polworth and Iain Vigurs were the only ones to score in the shootout to hand John Robertson's men a 2-0 win on penalties and the bonus point.
In the derby between Brechin City and Forfar Athletic, Mark Millar took the game to spot-kicks with a late penalty after Isaac layne had given Brechin a second-half lead.
Brechin moved into third place, one point behind Falkirk, after Kalvin Orsi's winning penalty earned the bonus point.
Inverness Caley Thistle manager John Robertson blamed a lack of a killer instinct for his side failing to earn all three points.
""In terms of the ball, we dominated most of the match,"" said Robertson. ""We knew Stirling would be at it and they were, all credit to Dave Mackay and his team.
""We lacked belief in the first half, had great chances to score and didn't take them. Second half we said up the tempo and get at them, which we did. But we just couldn't find that killer instinct.
""The more it went, the more frustrating it was. I thought we were going to be here until midnight with the penalties. Two scored out of eight, that's incredible. Two of our guys missed the target and for professional players that's bad technique.""",Kyle Lafferty scored on his debut to give Hearts a 1-0 win over League Two Elgin City in the League Cup.

The 42-year-old Canadian was arrested in Thailand in 2007 following a global manhunt and a worldwide appeal for public information by Interpol.
He has spent time in jail in both Thailand and Canada for sexually abusing young boys.
Corrections officials from the province of British Columbia (BC) issued a public warning following Neil's release on Sunday.
BC Corrections spokeswoman Cindy Rose said in a statement that Neil will be ""subject to an intensive level of monitoring and supervision in the community"".
It includes:
Neil was arrested 10 years ago when Interpol, the international police agency, appealed for help after experts unscrambled his digitally-swirled internet photos.
It was the first time Interpol had made a direct worldwide appeal for public information in a case.
Online images of Neil showing him abusing young boys had been manipulated to disguise his face with a swirl pattern, but German computer specialists were able to produce identifiable images.
Neil was jailed in Thailand between August 2008 and September 2012 following a conviction for sexual offences against two boys.  He was released and deported to Canada.
In December 2015 he pleaded guilty to five new charges involving the sexual abuse of young boys in Cambodia and possession of child pornography in Canada.  His sentenced was reduced due to time already served.
Neil, originally from Maple Ridge, BC, had spent about 15 years in Asia teaching English.",Convicted paedophile Christopher Paul Neil has been released from custody and will settle in Vancouver.
39990952,"It looked at the number of accidents recorded at each junction, then weighted the results according to the severity of injuries sustained and how many cyclists were active in the area.
The Arkleston Road/A761 junction in Paisley headed the list.
The charity, which promotes walking and cycling, said the results highlight the importance of better infrastructure.
The findings will be presented at the Scottish Transport Applications and Research conference this week.
Locations with dangerous junctions included Wallyford, Dundee, Tranent, Inverness and Stirling.
Roundabouts were featured in eight of the dangerous junctions, with seven others being T-junctions or staggered junctions.
Sustrans Scotland director John Lauder said: ""Safety is often cited as the main reason why people don't cycle for more of the journeys they make every day.
""This research highlights the importance of having high-quality cycling infrastructure in place at junctions, so that collisions can be prevented.
""We know that better cycle infrastructure increases the feeling of safety and ultimately the number of people on bikes.""
He added: ""Put quite simply: the more people in a place who cycle, the safer it becomes for everyone.""
Sustrans Scotland has been working with local authorities to address some of the specific concerns.
It contributed to a consultation on improving one of Edinburgh's busiest junctions, at Sheriffhall roundabout.
A Transport Scotland spokesman said: ""The Scottish government remains committed to undertaking improvements at Sheriffhall roundabout having announced the preferred route option earlier this year.
""As part of the scheme, grade separation at Sheriffhall will improve access for pedestrians and cyclists compared to the existing arrangement.
""By allowing Edinburgh City Bypass traffic to pass over it will significantly reduce congestion and improve accessibility for all modes of transport including pedestrians and cyclists.""",A list of the country's top 20 cycling collision hotspots has been drawn up by the charity Sustrans Scotland.

Tests later showed that the tumour was not malignant, but Redknapp will have further check-ups every three months.
""I could feel it in my body - I knew it wasn't right. This is the first time I've been properly worried,"" he said.
Redknapp took charge of the Championship club in April after Gianfranco Zola resigned, and succeeded in saving them from relegation.
The former West Ham and Tottenham boss signed a one-year contract with Birmingham the following month.
He told the paper that it was his wife Sandra who urged him to seek medical advice.
""They cut it out, took it away, sent it away to make sure it is not malignant and luckily everything was OK. I know I am fortunate,"" Redknapp said.
""They cut it out, there was no other option. Once they did that I was up and about after a couple of days. I am relaxed about it now because what can you do?""

39739713,"Notts folded on the eve of the Women's Super League One Spring Series season, prompting concern that players would be left without a club for the campaign.
Players told the BBC on Friday that the timing had left them ""abandoned"".
Four of England's squad for Euro 2017 - Carly Telford, Jo Potter, Laura Bassett and Jade Moore - played for Notts.
A Football Association statement on Thursday said: ""The FA can confirm that it has given Notts County Ladies players the opportunity to move to new clubs within England with immediate effect.
""Following Notts County's decision last week to terminate its women's team, the FA has worked closely with the PFA and wider stakeholders to enable players to find new clubs as soon as possible.
""Players are now in a position to sign for new clubs in England. They may also move to leagues in other countries where the transfer window is open.""
A statement from the Professional Footballers' Association on Friday had said: ""We have also been in discussions with the FA and FAWSL to ensure that players can register with other clubs outside of the transfer window given the exceptional circumstances the players find themselves in due to no fault of their own.""
What remains unclear is how many WSL clubs will have contingency within their budgets for the Spring Series to sign additional players.","Notts County Ladies players will be allowed to sign for other sides after the club were liquidated, despite the English transfer window being closed."
38880809,"It has announced that loans made to students in England between 2002 and 2006 will be put up for sale - to be followed by other pre-2012 loans - with the aim of raising £12bn.
Universities Minister Jo Johnson said the sale would have ""no impact on people with student loans"".
But the National Union of Students said it was an ""ugly move on students"".
""It is outrageous that bankers will profit off the backs of graduates who took out loans because they had no other option,"" said the union's vice-president Sorana Vieru.
The government has had a long-standing aim to sell the student loan book to private investors - with types of loans being sold in separate stages.
Over the next four years it aims to dispose of the loans from before 2012, when tuition fees in England were trebled to £9,000 per year.
The slice of loans now being put on sale - dating from 2002 to 2006 - have a face value of £4bn.
The government is promising that there will be ""no changes to the terms and conditions"" for borrowers - so that rates of repayment for former students will remain the same.
It means that interest on these student loans will become an income for private investors, but repayments will continue to be collected through taxation and the Student Loans Company.
The Intergenerational Foundation think tank has calculated that a student borrowing for three years' tuition could pay back £54,000 - before debts are cancelled after 30 years.
The Universities Minister Jo Johnson says the sale of assets is part of the drive to bring ""public finances under control"".
But he said it would ""only proceed once we are satisfied that it represents value for money for the taxpayer"".
David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, said it was the right time to start the sale process.
""This sale makes sense for taxpayers and will play an important contribution in our work to repair the public finances,"" he said.
But John Pugh, the Liberal Democrats education spokesman, said: ""The Conservative Brexit fire-sale is well underway, as ministers scrabble around to sell just about anything that isn't nailed down.""
Earlier versions of student loans have previously been sold - but it is now approaching the point in which the bigger ""income-contingent loans"", introduced in 2006 when fees rose to £3,000, will be the next in line for sale.
The National Union of Students attacked the sale as ""economic illiteracy"" and warned that it would begin a process in which loans would have to be made more attractive to private buyers - at the expense of student borrowers.
""It doesn't just penalise students and graduates, it is taking money from the public purse which could and should be spent on services over the long term,"" said Ms Vieru.
However, Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said that there was much ""misinformation"" about the sale of loans, and the key issue was making sure that the taxpayer received good value.
""What the government is doing may make some sense,"" said Mr Hillman.
""Why should it keep the loans forever on its books? Why shouldn't the demand of pension funds for long-term income streams be satisfied if there are no clear losers? Why shouldn't we look for imaginative ways to reduce the national debt?""
Consumer finance expert Martin Lewis welcomed assurances about borrowers not facing a negative, but cautioned: ""It is a question of 'watch this space' to see if their rhetoric is matched by their delivery.""
Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: ""This government never learn any lessons - this sale will do nothing to ease the burden of debt piled on students by the Tories who have trebled tuition fees and scrapped maintenance grants.""",The government has started the process of selling more student loan debt to the private financial sector.
34921212,"It was widely anticipated the Spending Review would confirm the need for police efficiencies would remain at the top of the agenda, at least until 2020.
The Home Office is not one of the favoured ""protected"" ministries shielded from cuts.
And as 71% of its gross spending goes on crime and policing, that is where most of the department's cuts have bitten.
Add to that Home Secretary Theresa May's determination to reform policing, and there was a strong sense the government would not change course.
That was certainly the expectation at Manchester Town Hall, where chief constables and police and crime commissioners (PCCs) had gathered for their annual joint conference.
At 12:30, a large group of them took their places around a television set in a room set aside for exhibitors to watch the chancellor's statement. The mood was sombre. Most chiefs and PCCs had been planning for cuts of 20-25%.
The Inspectorate of Constabulary had suggested that by 2018, forces would have to shed at least 12,000 officer, staff and police community support officer (PCSO) posts, with further reductions after that.
The inspectorate, known for its careful, measured commentary, warned some forces might not be able to withstand another round of cuts, because they were not efficient enough. It said the ""operational viability"" of some could be ""in jeopardy"".
The National Police Chiefs Council, which co-ordinates the work of forces, feared the job losses would be even worse - 35,000 by 2020, which, Sara Thornton, who chairs the council, said in July, would be a ""game changer"".
Constabularies with large urban areas stood to lose the most, as they tend to rely more on Home Office funding, among them Northumbria, which gets 85% of its income from central government, and the West Midlands, 83%.
So, when the announcement came, towards the end of Mr Osborne's statement, that there would be no further policing cuts, there was genuine disbelief, mixed with delight.
Kevin Hurley, Surrey's PCC, described the atmosphere as ""euphoric"", as though England had won the World Cup.
Essex Chief Constable Steve Kavanagh held his hand over his mouth in shock. ""I'm aghast,"" he said.
At moments such as this, journalists reach for the official documents to look at the small print. Could it really be true?
The Treasury statement appears unequivocal. ""The government will protect overall police spending in line with inflation - an increase of Â£900m by 2019-20,"" it says.
The Home Office press release, however, says the funding will enable individual forces to maintain their budgets at current cash levels.
That means each force will not automatically get enough money to keep pace with inflation. They will get the same in 2019-20 as they are getting this year.
Instead, extra funding will be distributed in certain specialist policing areas - firearms, tackling cybercrime and child sexual exploitation, some of which might be dealt with regionally - as well as to forces that demonstrate efficiencies.
It is that extra funding that enables the government to say overall police funding is going up in real terms.
In other words, the Home Office has accepted arguments that some aspects of policing need more central co-ordination and constabularies that come up with viable efficiency plans should be rewarded. It is called ""top slicing"" - and that is quite a major change, and one it is easy to overlook amid the relief there are to be no cuts.
The other announcement, which has been broadly welcomed, is PCCs will get more ""flexibility"" to raise funds for policing from the council tax policing levy, known as the precept.
Until now, the government has limited how much PCCs can raise through the precept, by restricting annual increases in England to under 2%. Rises higher than that require a referendum. Different rules apply in Wales.
The ability to raise the precept by more - how much is not yet clear - could allow those constabularies that rely on it most heavily, such as Surrey and Dorset, to generate substantial extra income.
That the government decided to perform an about-turn on police spending owes much to effective lobbying by police leaders who warned further cuts put the police in risky territory.
A number of senior officers and PCCs made representations to the home secretary over the past few months. They were not shroud-wavers - but people whose views she respected.
They pointed to the growing signs of strain on police forces and their ability to deal with cyber-fraud and sexual offences, reports of which have gone up by 88% since 2012.
The attacks in Paris then cemented the view in Whitehall the cuts could not go ahead as planned.
If the chancellor had limited the cuts to 10%, which police said they could just about cope with, there would have been relief among most chiefs and PCCs.
His decision to go even further, no cuts at all, which took the opposition benches by complete surprise, suggests in the end politics played a key part too.
Presented by Chancellor George Osborne, the Spending Review sets out what government spending will be over the next four years, while the Autumn Statement is an annual update of government plans for the economy.

39673283,"Watch out for plenty of brinkmanship, particularly on a key amendment to the Criminal Finances Bill (see below). This will also make the whole timetable pretty fluid and prone to last minute alteration as new events are crowbarred in.
A few of the MPs who are departing at this election may deliver their Commons swansongs - and the final PMQs could be a particularly bare-knuckle occasion.
Meanwhile, up on the committee corridor, it's raining reports, as the various select committees rush out the results of their inquiries - up to 50 more reports should be out before dissolution.
The subjects include: the Women and Equalities Committee on Building for Equality: Disability and the Built Environment; the Education Committee on Exiting the EU: challenges and opportunities for higher education; Scottish Affairs on Jobcentre Plus closures, and Public Accounts (which has quite a few offerings in the pipeline) on the HMRC Estate.
The Commons meets at 2.30 pm for Communities and Local Government questions - with any urgent questions or ministerial statements likely to be slotted in at 3.30pm.
The main event will be the rushing through of the Northern Ireland (Ministerial Appointments and Regional Rates) Bill, which is designed to keep the devolved system in place while the political parties on the Assembly negotiate to set up a new executive.
The adjournment led by the Conservative Richard Drax in on primates as pets - it will raise the issues highlighted in a petition of more than 110,000 signatures calling for new welfare standards for primates. This had been gathered by visitors to Monkey World, a primate rescue centre in Mr Drax's constituency, which calls for a change the law so that those who want to keep primates have to meet exacting standards of welfare that equal those found in zoos and wildlife parks.
In Westminster Hall (4.30pm) MPs debate e-petition 172405  on closed book examinations for GCSE English Literature. The exams require students to learn and memorise as many as 250 quotations from 15 poems, two plays and a novella. The petition argues that the exams should not test the student's memory, but how they interpret texts. The petition has attracted 109,285 signatures.
The scheduled hearing of the Commons Liaison Committee, the super committee of select committee chairs with the prime minister, has been cancelled because of the election. They now aim to hold a hearing as soon as possible in the new parliament, but since the new set of chairs are unlikely to be in place before mid-July, that may not be before the summer recess.
In the Lords, business opens (2.30pm) with tributes to Sir David Beamish who has stood down as the top official of the House, the Clerk of the Parliaments (the Clerk of the Commons is ""under-clerk"") to be led by the Leader of the House, Baroness Evans.
And then peers move on to a series of orders and regulations, including the Trade Union (Deduction of Union Subscriptions from Wages in the Public Sector) Regulations 2017, the Immigration Act 2016 (Consequential Amendments) (Biometrics and Legal Aid) Regulations 2017, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2017 among others.
Then there is a short debate on the report 'Race in the workplace: The McGregor-Smith Review' - which calls for all employers with more than 50 people to set aspirational targets to increase diversity and inclusion throughout their organisations - not just at the bottom. Companies should look at the make-up of the area in which they are recruiting to establish the right target. For instance, the proportion of working age people from a BME background in London and Birmingham is already over 40%, with Manchester not far behind. Baroness McGregor-Smith chairs the Women's Business Council, a working group that seeks to maximise women's contribution to economic growth, and was appointed by the then Business Secretary Sajid Javid, to lead a review of the issues faced by businesses in developing black and minority ethnic talent from when they start work through to the executive level.
The Commons meets at 11.30am for Justice questions (watch out for fallout from the demise of the Prisons and Courts Bill, which has had to be scrapped because there is not enough time to get it through before the election) to be followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from Labour's Rachel Reeves.
This is on fees and charges to unauthorised overdrafts, which are often higher than those for the now capped payday loans - an issue she has pursued on the Treasury Select Committee. She wants the Financial Conduct Authority to introduce a cap on the charges to bring them into line with the cap on payday loans.
The day's main event is the committee of the whole House debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill - which puts the measures announced in the Budget into effect - although the time pressure imposed by the election will probably mean controversial sections are stripped out. MPs will also debate Lords amendments to the Health Service Medical Supplies (Costs) Bill.
In Westminster Hall, there's a Backbench Business Committee debate on Post Office closures (9.30am- 11am), followed by a series of debates led by individual MPs: the Conservative former education secretary Nicky Morgan raises Police and local authority guidance on dogs attacking other dogs (11am- 1.30 am);  the Conservative Derek Thomas has a debate on employment opportunities in food and farming (2.30pm- 4pm); the Conservative James Heappey discusses Wells' bid for UK City of Culture (4pm-4.30pm) and the Conservative David Mackintosh leads a debate on grandparents' rights to access to grandchildren (4.30pm -5.30pm).
In the Lords (2.30pm) peers bash their way through Commons amendments to the Technical and Further Education Bill, the Neighbourhood Planning Bill (there is now all-party consensus around an amendment to provide protection for pubs in the planning system), and the Bus Services Bill.
Then comes the main event: the report stage and third reading of the Criminal Finances Bill - watch out for the cross party amendment in the names of the Crossbencher Baroness Stern, Labour's Lord Rosser, the Lib Dem Baroness Kramer and the Conservative Lord Kirkhope, to require a register of the beneficial ownership of companies based in UK overseas territories like Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos Islands - which they argue will improve transparency and help clamp down on money laundering.
Finally, there is  a short debate on support for the steel industry and its role in the government's industrial strategy led by Lord Mendelsohn.
The Commons opens (11.30am) with Welsh questions, followed at noon by  Prime Minister's questions - which, unless face to face TV debates are held, will be the only direct confrontation between Theresa May and her rivals before polling day.
Then comes a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the SNP's Alan Brown, who wants to end the use of cash retentions in the construction industry. This is where a proportion of a sub contract is held over by the main contractor to sort any defects on the job - but sub-contractors routinely fail to get their money back in a timely manner or sometimes not at all, sometimes because of the insolvency of main contractor. Mr Brown is proposing a scheme similar to the tenancy deposit scheme which will provide independent protection.
After that it's back to the washup, and consideration of Lords amendments to the Digital Economy Bill (issues in play include more superfast broadband, a proposed independent commission to set the BBC Licence Fee, a requirement that public service broadcasters are prominent on the channel displays of digital TV systems, and much much more), followed by Lords amendments to the Criminal Finances Bill (see above).
The adjournment led by Labour's Chris Evans is on the effect of diesel fumes in Islwyn - his constituency.
In Westminster Hall  there are debates on school funding in the North East of England, led by Labour's Sharon Hodgson (9.30am -11am);  the Colne to Skipton railway led by the Conservative Andrew Stephenson (11am - 11.30am) and learning outside the classroom, led by Labour's Barry Sheerman (4pm- 4.30pm).
In the Lords (3pm) questions include the Green peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb on refining the definition of domestic extremism to enable the police to focus on those involved in terrorism and serious crime - she used the Data Protection Act to access her police file, and found she was considered a potential extremist, and had been under surveillance by the police's ""domestic extremism"" unit from 2001 until 2012, including during her candidacy to become London's mayor.
She is still pressing for answers about the surveillance and the alleged destruction of documents on her case.
Then peers zoom through the remaining private members' bills sent over by the Commons - starting with the committee stage of the Local Audit (Public Access to Documents) Bill, followed by the Merchant Shipping (Homosexual Conduct) Bill and the Guardianship (Missing Persons) Bill - and the Farriers (Registration) Bill. All will have their third reading debates the next day.
In the Commons, MPs open (9.30am) with Exiting the European Union questions, followed by any remaining loose legislative ends sent over by their lordships. There may or may not be any.
And the final debate of the 2015 Parliament will be the SNP MP Chris Stephens' adjournment on the cost of telephone calls to the Department for Work and Pensions.
In the Lords (from 11am) questions to ministers include the Conservative, Baroness Couttie, the Leader of Westminster City Council, calling for legislation to regulate pedicab drivers. Then peers will move on to those third reading debates - on the Local Audit (Public Access to Documents) Bill, the Merchant Shipping (Homosexual Conduct) Bill, the Guardianship (Missing Persons) Bill and the Farriers (Registration) Bill.
And their final task will be to approve some statutory instruments on Driving Disqualifications and Student Fees, Awards and Support- although that last one comes with a regret motion attached, from Labour's Lord Clark of Windermere. So it is possible that the final act of the House of Lords in this Parliament might be to defeat the government.
And when all is done, the mildly pythonesque ceremony of prorogation will follow, with much doffing of cocked hats and flowery cod-medieval language.
Some MPs, mostly those who're not seeking re-election, usually come to the bar of the House to watch the spectacle.
And that will be it until Parliament reconvenes after the election, On 3 May (following dissolution at 00:01 BST that morning) a meeting of the Privy Council will issue a proclamation to declare the meeting of the new Parliament with 14 June the likely date.
The only business at the meeting will be to elect a Speaker. The next day the anointed Speaker will receive the Royal Approbation, and this will allow MPs and peers start to swear the Oath of Allegiance. This continues until Friday. New MPs then have the chance to go on various induction courses and are allocated offices.
My bet is that 21 June  will see the state opening, with the government's plans for the coming session announced.","It's the last rites of the 2015 Parliament - and in a frenzy of last minute deal-making, the legislation which can be completed will be rushed to the finishing line, while all manner of bills and other parliamentary business is dropped for lack of time."
33858350,"All Japan's nuclear plants were gradually shut down after a series of meltdowns at the Fukushima plant sparked by the tsunami and earthquake.
But after passing stringent new safety tests, Kyushu Electric Power restarted the number one reactor at its Sendai plant on Tuesday morning.
There is still strong public unease about a return to nuclear power.
Protests have been taking place outside the Sendai plant and at Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's residence in Tokyo, about 1,000 km (600 miles) away.
The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo says that after being told a disaster like Fukushima could never happen, public confidence has been shaken.
A total of 25 plants have applied to be restarted, he says, but all are facing legal challenges from concerned locals.
What is happening inside the Sendai reactor?
Kyushu said reactor No.1 at Sendai began operating again at 10:30 local time (01:30 GMT).
TV images showed the plant's control room as workers turned the reactor back on.
Kyushu Electric spokesman Tomomitsu Sakata said the reactor had gone back online without any problems.
It will be about 24 hours before a full reaction takes place, and the plant is expected to start generating power by Friday. It will reach full capacity some time next month.
Prime Minister Abe said on Monday that the reactors had passed ""the world's toughest safety screening"".
""I would like Kyushu Electric to put safety first and take utmost precautions for the restart,"" he said.
Since shutting down all nuclear plants, Japan has been relying on imported fossil fuels for its energy, at huge expense. The government has said nuclear power must resume to cut both import bills and growing CO2 emissions.
Experts have also warned that reactors left idle for years tend to experience teething problems and that such a mass restart of dormant reactors has never been attempted before, says our correspondent.
Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority approved two reactors at the Sendai plant last September under stricter safety rules. The second reactor is due to be restarted in October.
More than $100m (Â£64m) has been spent on fitting new safety systems at the Sendai plant.
But local residents say the new safety regulations are not stringent enough - they are worried about potential dangers from active volcanoes in the region.
Protesters were rallied by Naoto Kan, prime minister at the time of the Fukushima crisis, who told the crowd: ""We don't need nuclear plants.""
He said the Fukushima disaster had ""exposed the myth of safe and cheap nuclear power, which turned out to be dangerous and expensive"".
One of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded struck off the coast of Japan in March 2011, triggering a huge tsunami which damaged the Fukushima nuclear plant, leading to meltdown.
Almost 16,000 people died and more than 2,500 are still listed as missing, though none of the deaths has been linked to the nuclear disaster.
Some 160,000 people were evacuated from the surrounding areas in the following weeks - continuing high radiation levels mean most have never been able to return home.",Japan has restarted its first nuclear reactor under new safety rules following the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Ireland flanker Ferris drew attention to the incident during England's 30-9 Six Nations victory on 17 March, but it was not spotted by referee Nigel Owens.
""I am disappointed by the result,"" said Hartley, who may decide to appeal.
""I will wait for the written judgment as to how the panel came to their conclusion.
""I now have to put it behind me and focus on supporting Saints in training and off the field.""
Hartley has been ruled out of the rest of the regular domestic season but he could return if Saints reach the Premiership final on 26 May.
The lowest suspension for biting is 12 weeks, with a maximum sanction of four years.
But an independent Six Nations disciplinary committee decided Hartley's case was worthy of a lesser punishment after Tuesday's hearing.
""The offence merited a low entry point in the International Rugby Board's table of sanctions and allowed mitigation of four weeks,"" said a statement released by the committee.
The panel listened to evidence from both Hartley and Ferris, who spoke via videolink, while England forwards coach Graham Rowntree and Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder also represented their player.
Rowntree said: ""It is unfortunate for Dylan and Northampton, especially as he was in good form during the Six Nations, and he has developed as a player and a leader.
""However, we are looking forward to him being available for the tour to South Africa.""
Mallinder added: ""We are disappointed that Dylan has been suspended, especially at a crucial part of the season.""
It is the second time Hartley has received a lengthy suspension from the game. He received a six-month ban for eye gouging while playing for Northampton against Wasps in 2007.",England hooker Dylan Hartley has been handed an eight-week ban for biting the finger of Ireland's Stephen Ferris.
22328898,"The pro-European cabinet minister said UKIP had no positive policies and was just ""against"" foreigners.
UKIP leader Nigel Farage hit back by accusing Mr Clarke of holding millions of British people ""in utter contempt"".
He said Mr Clarke was ""obviously not interested"" in winning back disaffected Tory voters at Thursday's local elections in England and Wales.
It comes as UKIP accused the Tories of conducting a ""morally reprehensible"" smear campaign against its local election candidates.
The anti-EU party has expanded rapidly, recruiting a record 1,732 candidates to contest Thursday's local elections.  It admits it has not had the time or money to vet all of them properly.
UKIP says it has evidence that smears about its candidates are being spread by Conservative Central Office, which it claims has been trawling would-be UKIP councillors' Twitter and Facebook pages for months.
""Were we inclined to return the favour, we would find even more examples to use against them.
""We deem that using our candidates as cannon fodder to undermine a political campaign (is) morally reprehensible and downright dirty,"" said a spokesman.
The party is investigating six candidates over links to the BNP and other far right groups or alleged racist and homophobic comments, following stories in national and local newspapers.
""I am glad they have found some candidates in the BNP because we don't want them. We are quite pleased. We don't want these people in the party,"" a UKIP spokesman said.
He said the row showed the Conservative Party was ""rattled"" by UKIP, which is hoping to make significant gains in Tory heartlands on Thursday, but added: ""This isn't scrutiny, it's smear.""
Asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr show about UKIP's claims, Transport Secretary Patrick McLaughlin said all candidates had to be scrutinised, but added: ""I don't know anything about a smear campaign.""
But his cabinet colleague, Ken Clarke, minister without portfolio, added fuel to the row in an interview with Sky News.
He said: ""They of course have not been able to vet their candidates. Fringe right parties do tend to collect a number of waifs and strays...
""Some of them are saying quite different things now they are in politics than their actual views.""
Asked whether he agreed with David Cameron's 2006 claim that UKIP was made up of ""fruitcakes and closet racists"", Mr Clarke replied: ""I have met people who satisfy both those descriptions in UKIP.
""Indeed, some of the people who have assured me they are going to vote UKIP I would put in that category. I rather suspect they have never voted for me.""
Mr Clarke said he was sure that ""most of the UKIP people are perfectly nice when they are having a drink"".
But he added: ""The trouble with UKIP really is it is just a protest party.
""It is against the political class, it is against foreigners, it is against immigrants. But it does not have any very positive policies. They do not know what they are for.""
He added: ""The temptation to ordinary voters to UKIP is these are very difficult times, the political classes are regarded as having got us into a mess.
""It is very tempting to vote for a collection of clowns or indignant, angry people, who promise that somehow they will allow us to take your revenge on people who caused it.""
Conservative backbencher Nadine Dorries criticised Mr Clarke's intervention, saying in a Twitter message: ""I suppose Ken Clarke's strategy of being rude to and insulting Tories about to vote UKIP means we don't want them back for general election?""
UKIP leader Nigel Farage echoed Ms Dorries' comments, saying: ""It is obvious that Mr Clarke holds millions of people in this country in utter contempt.
""UKIP are attracting supporters from all three main parties and, significantly those who have either not voted for over 10 years or have never voted before in their lives.
""Instead of slagging them off maybe he should try to wrap his head around the idea that UKIP are appealing to people due to the failure of the bloated self-satisfied political machine of which he is such a typical member.
""He obviously doesn't care and isn't at all interested in attracting those millions to vote for the Conservatives, well so be it. The way things are going they won't be doing so any time soon.""
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said UKIP was a ""very seductive"" option for people who wanted to say ""to hell with mainstream politics"" but he urged voters to look at the party's policies.
UKIP has also dismissed claims in The Observer that the party's policy-making process in chaos.
The newspaper published leaked e-mails between party treasurer Stuart Wheeler and MEP Godfrey Bloom, in which Mr Bloom advises UKIP to adopt policies ""off the shelf"" from right-wing think tanks, because trying to reach agreement on where it stood on issues was like ""herding cats"".
A UKIP spokesman said: ""I am glad they are discussing policies. So they should be.""","Veteran Tory Ken Clarke has waded into his party's war of words with UKIP by branding them ""a collection of clowns""."

36584812,"Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi announced that Tiran and Sanafir would be transferred in April, during a visit by Saudi Arabia's King Salman.
More than 150 people were jailed in connection with protests over the deal, though many were later acquitted or had their sentences reduced on appeal.
The Egyptian government has said it will challenge Tuesday's ruling.
Tiran and Sanafir are uninhabited and located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, a strategic part of the Red Sea bordered by Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
Egyptian troops have been stationed there since 1950 at Riyadh's request.
Mr Sisi's decision in April to cede control of them to Saudi Arabia sparked widespread criticism.
The president was accused of violating the constitution and ""selling"" the islands in return for a multi-billion dollar aid package unveiled by King Salman during his visit.
But Mr Sisi insisted that Tiran and Sanafir had always belonged to Saudi Arabia.
On Tuesday, Egypt's State Council, an administrative court, issued a verdict annulling April's maritime borders agreement between Cairo and Riyadh.
The maritime border agreement signed earlier this year between Egypt and Saudi Arabia took many Egyptians by surprise.
Since then, protesters have taken to the streets calling the arrangement unconstitutional, and accusing the government of giving away Egyptian territories in return for aid packages and investments worth billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia, a strong backer of President Sisi.
Some of these protesters were arrested and charged with disrupting public order. A few are still behind bars.
The lawsuit was filed by a number of prominent human rights lawyers, headed by a former presidential candidate, Khaled Ali.
When the verdict was issued, many cheered inside the courtroom, chanting ""the islands are Egyptian"". But the legal battle has not come to an end yet, because the decision can be appealed.
The verdict stated that the two islands would ""remain under Egyptian sovereignty"".
If it is approved by the country's High Administrative Court it will become legally binding.
However, the State Lawsuits Authority, which represents the Egyptian state in lawsuits, said on Tuesday evening that it would challenge the ruling, state television reported.
Mr Sisi has cracked down on all dissent since leading the military's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in 2013.
Since then, more than 1,000 people have been killed and 40,000 are believed to have been jailed, most of them supporters of Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood.",An Egyptian judge has quashed a government decision to hand control of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia.
30671127,"Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Thomas Winsor said forces had mainly ""done well"" with 20% cuts in four years and more savings were likely.
Sir Thomas said a ""smaller service"" would have to ""work smarter"".
In December, the chief of the Met Police warned public safety would be at risk unless radical measures were taken to deal with funding cuts.
But speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, newly knighted Sir Thomas said: ""Austerity is here to stay.
""The police have already made, and done it well in the main, cuts of 20% in the last four years and they are facing cuts of a further 5% next year.
""There will inevitably be a time where they can't take any more but let us remember that measured crime has fallen dramatically - but so have the demands made on the police.""
Asked if there was room for further cuts, Sir Thomas said: ""In some respects there are further efficiencies to be obtained, that is undoubtedly the case.
""They [police forces] need to work smarter because they will be working smaller.""
Sir Thomas said forces had not done enough work to analyse new demands being made on them, particularly with regards to cyber crime.
He also said that while any crime reported to the police had to be taken seriously, there were some crimes that were ""more serious than others"".
""Nobody would argue that shoplifting is as serious as a violent assault and therefore the police need to look for the crimes that matter most to people, that do greatest harms to communities - serious and organised crime, drugs, violent offences, the grooming and sexual exploitation of children,"" he said.
Last month, Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said that unless police ""act fast"" and with ""courage"" to implement far-reaching reforms, the cuts would endanger public safety.
He suggested police forces in England and Wales should merge and share resources with other emergency services.
Sir Hugh Orde, the Association of Chief Police Officers' president, has also recently warned that police forces were struggling to deal with reductions in funding.","Police cuts in England and Wales are ""here to stay"", the head of the police watchdog has said."

It comes after more than 4,000 people signed a petition against the project, to which the council allocated Â£3.5m.

Tweeddale councillor Keith Cockburn said the group will address ""public disquiet"" over the decision-making process.

32166352,"Dead Sheep focuses on the events leading up to Howe's infamous 1990 resignation speech, in which he savaged his long-time boss and one-time political soulmate Margaret Thatcher.
That speech - one of the first to be shown on television live from the House of Commons - was the beginning of Thatcher's downfall as prime minister.
It was all the more remarkable because no one thought Howe had it in him to be Thatcher's political assassin. Least of all Thatcher herself.
Howe had been at her side as her chancellor, foreign secretary and deputy prime minister since the very beginning of her reign in Downing Street.
But he was often viewed as an ineffectual yes-man, and was someone she increasingly treated with impatience and disdain, in front of cabinet colleagues.
The play's title comes from one of the most widely-quoted political put-downs of all time, when Labour's Dennis Healey described being attacked by Howe as like being ""savaged by a dead sheep"".
Howe's frustration at Thatcher's increasingly strident anti-EU stance at a time when he was trying to negotiate Britain's membership of the European Exchange Rate mechanism, and his demotion to the ""non-job"" of deputy prime minister, was the trigger for his resignation.
His resignation speech, given two weeks after he quit the cabinet, stunned the Commons into silence, as he compared himself to a cricketer who had been sent out to the crease, only to discover his bat had been smashed by the team's captain.
But in an era packed with larger-than-life Conservative politicians such as Michael Heseltine, Alan Clark and Thatcher herself, the famously uncharismatic Howe is still not the obvious choice to place centre stage.
""I just admire him so much because he really, really meant it. In all these films and plays I've seen he gets treated like a shifty-eyed buffoon and I was thinking 'No!,'"" playwright Jonathan Maitland told BBC News after the play's opening night.
""I've read his book umpteen times. He agonised over it and he really, really cared.
""And it was a very difficult thing for him to do and he stood up and did the right thing for his country and his party and I just think that's incredibly heroic. He's just a hero. He's a political hero.""
Maitland is hoping Dead Sheep will strike a chord with fellow Howe fans.
""A lot of people have nursed a secret admiration for him, because he's like Captain Mainwaring meets William Gladstone.""
The play focuses on Howe's relationship with the two formidable women in his life - Margaret Thatcher and his wife Elspeth. Maitland describes him as a ""panda between two lionesses"".
""It's a personal drama. It's a love story. Two types of marriage - Geoffrey's and Elspeth's, and Geoffrey's and Margaret's. One's a traditional marriage, one's a political marriage.""
He admits to using a bit of dramatic licence when it comes to portraying Howe's wife, played by Jill Baker, in the Lady Macbeth mould - a key scene sees Elspeth, encouraging a hesitant Howe, played by James Wilby, to go for the jugular in his resignation speech.
""The truth is she saw the speech the night before and she said 'are you sure you want to go that far?'
""That's not very dramatic, so in the play, he's written a stinker, he feels bad about it, she turns him round and inspires him to write a better one.""
Elspeth did inspire the speech, insists Maitland, ""not quite the way it appears in the play but I don't think anyone will accuse us of being dishonest.""
He admits it was a risk casting a man, Steve Nallon, as Thatcher. Nallon, who voiced Thatcher on Spitting Image, gives a pitch perfect reproduction of Thatcher's voice and mannerisms.
""He gives it a kind of comic energy which it otherwise wouldn't have, if an ordinary actress was playing Thatcher,"" says Maitland.
""He gives an incredible performance and it's a risk I'd take every day of the year.""
Maitland believes the play has a lot of contemporary relevance, particularly with the ongoing debate about Britain's relationship with Europe, but above all, he says:  ""I wanted it to be a love letter to old style politics, where being rubbish on TV didn't matter.
""And I think it tells us that's OK to stick to your guns and do something that's really unpopular and to fall on your sword. Because so many politicians these days wouldn't have the guts to do that.""
Maitland, a former BBC journalist, has spoken about the paucity of right wing drama on the British stage, but he tells me:  ""I wouldn't want anyone to think this is a right wing play.
""What it is, is not a left wing play. I just think it's healthy and desirable, as does Nicholas Hytner, the departing director of the National Theatre, to have plays that don't always come at it from the left.""
Dead Sheep, by the Cahoots Theatre Company, is at the Park Theatre, in Finsbury Park, until 9 May.","The grey, unassuming Sir Geoffrey Howe, now Lord Howe of Aberavon, is not many people's idea of a political hero - but a new play opening in north London aims to change that."
37286362,"No advantage was being sought for Britain's 264 athletes in Rio, he said.
Concerns have been raised that some Paralympic athletes are being deliberately mismatched.
But Hollingsworth said: ""We are here to win medals, but within both the letter and the spirit of the Paralympics.""
Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, an 11-time Paralympic champion, has said the issue ""goes to the heart of the integrity of the sport"".
The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) says the system is always under review, while UK Athletics said it will review classifications after Rio.
The Paralympics start on 7 September and run until 18 September.
The classification system puts athletes into groups depending on the level of their impairment to try to ensure fair competition.
But British T37 200m sprinter Bethany Woodward told the Sunday Times she was withdrawing from the ParalympicsGB squad for Rio and had lost faith in the way the team was selected.
Woodward, 23, who has cerebral palsy, said: ""I represented my country for a long time but if I can't compete like I used to compete, because they've brought in people who are not like me in terms of disability, what's the point?""
UK Athletics has said that Woodward was not in consideration for selection because she had not met the necessary criteria.
It has also been claimed some competitors try to manipulate their classification to compete against athletes with more severe impairments and therefore improve their chances of success.
A recent IPC report found no clear evidence of ""intentional misrepresentation"" after analysing some 80 cases.
Media playback is not supported on this device
IPC head Sir Philip Craven has defended the classification system but told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""permanently being reviewed"".
""It is a developing system and a developing science,"" he said.
Asked whether there was a ""risk"" some countries were too keen on winning medals, Craven said he would not ""respond to that question"", adding: ""All countries are very keen on performing well and performing within the rules.""
Former Paralympic swimmer Natalie Jones said classifying athletes was a ""really hard job"", with more than 4,000 athletes to test worldwide.
But Hollingsworth insisted: ""We are very focused on getting the right athletes in the right class. We've got nobody going into the Games in our view who doesn't have the appropriate classification.
""I dispute a view that what has been discussed over the last few days should lead to conclusion there is anything along those lines going on.""
Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson told BBC Radio 5 live:
The reality is athletes will fall one side of the line or the other and that's what happens when you have these groupings.
The old system used to be very disability specific. They're moving it to sports-specific so it's how your impairment affects you doing that sport.
There's a system in place and athletes have to have faith and people watching have to have faith that the system is right. It doesn't mean it doesn't evolve and doesn't change and need to be looked at from time to time to check it's OK.
We have to take it on trust that the athletes are in the right class.",Claims that the classification system for disabled athletes is being manipulated to boost medal chances has been rejected by British Paralympic Association boss Tim Hollingsworth.

25518137,"In the 1960s and 70s, the spirits of scores of convicted Japanese war criminals were ""enshrined"" there.
The most controversial were the 14 ""Class A"" war criminals, including wartime leader Hideki Tojo, who were ""enshrined"" in the late 1970s.
These men were the ones who ordered and oversaw Japan's brutal war in China and South East Asia.
Yasukuni Shrine
It was a war in which millions died, in which there were widespread massacres of civilians, in which rape was routinely used as a weapon and where Japan used chemical and biological warfare against civilians.
So if the shrine is so offensive to China and South Korea why did Mr Abe go?
Firstly, because he wanted to.
Close observers of the Japanese prime minister say he is at heart a nationalist and a historical revisionist.
He believes the trials that convicted Japan's wartime leaders were ""victors' justice"".
His own grandfather Nobusuke Kishi served in the war cabinet and was arrested by the Americans on suspicion of being a Class A war criminal. He was later released without charge.
But the stain of association with Japan's war crimes in China never completely went away.
Secondly, Mr Abe's support base comes from the right wing of the Liberal Democratic Party.
According to Professor Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo, Mr Abe is ""showing he is a tough guy"", that he is not afraid of China. It is something that plays very well to his base.
But there is perhaps a bigger goal that Mr Abe has in mind.
He wants to radically revise Japan's post-war constitution.
This, too, is a long-held dream that started with his grandfather in the 1950s.
Mr Abe believes he is the man to complete the historic task of getting rid of the hated ""peace constitution"".
Like many on the right here, Mr Abe believes that constitution was forced on Japan by America and is a humiliation.
It imposes not only pacifism, but also Western notions of human rights and civil liberties. It rejects Japan's uniqueness in favour of ""universal values"".
Mr Abe would like to change a lot of this. But it will be very hard. And so he will need some help.
""Abe has provoked China, and China has reacted just as Abe wanted it to,"" says Prof Kingston. ""There is a shrewd political calculus at work here.""
What he means is that having an external threat in the shape of big and frightening China may be just what Mr Abe wants to help push through his controversial nationalist agenda at home.","Whatever Shinzo Abe says, any visit to the Yasakuni shrine by a Japanese prime minister is deeply political and sure to cause offence."
40030457,"As a result, people should be cautious about using them to judge what to eat, Stanford University scientists said.
The study recommended that companies release data showing how their devices work out measurements.
The accuracy of seven wrist devices were tested while 60 volunteers were asked to walk, run and cycle.
Researchers found that six out of seven of the fitness devices were good at estimating the heart rate of the person wearing it, with an error rate under 5%.
They were the Apple Watch, Fitbit Surge, Basis Peak, Microsoft Band, PulseOn and MIP Alpha 2 - but the Samsung Gear S2 had the highest error rate of 6.8%.
However, when it came to keeping track of energy used during exercise, the five devices that performed this function were all a long way out.
Not one of the devices had an error rate below 20% - and some, such as the PulseOn, were much more inaccurate, the US research team found.
Dr Euan Ashley, co-author of the study from the department of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford University, said the public should be aware of the strengths and limitations of fitness devices worn on the wrist.
""People need to know that on energy expenditure they give rough estimates.
""If you go to the gym, and you think you've lost 400 calories, then you might feel you've got 400 calories to play with,"" he said.
That could be an issue if people were basing their diet on what they thought they had burnt off, he said.
Technology for measuring heart rate had moved on quickly over the past five or six years, but on energy expenditure ""it's not quite there yet"", he added.
It may be that companies are not using heart rates in their calculations. There is also a very wide difference in calories burnt between one person and another.
For example, 10,000 steps could equate to anything from 400 kilocalories to 800 kilocalories lost, depending on a person's height and weight alone, the study said.
Dr David Ellis, lecturer in computation social science at Lancaster University, said working out the number of calories burnt was a tricky business and relied on many different factors such as height, weight, percentage of body fat, heart rate and more.
""However, because manufactures do not share the algorithms [which are constantly updated] used to determine calories burned, it is almost impossible to know the exact source of error at this stage,"" he said.
Fitness trackers can have a very positive effect on people's activity levels, so complete 100% accuracy may not be vital if the devices are encouraging more exercise.
But recent trials have suggested that wearing them doesn't always result in a positive outcome, or improve the chances of losing weight.
The researchers urged companies to be more transparent and publish the results of their own accuracy tests.
They said this would ensure the public and clinicians were aware of the devices' limitations.
The Stanford team has set up their own website to share this kind of data with others.","Most fitness trackers are good at measuring heart rate but poor at measuring calories burned, a study suggests."
34536258,"Jason Nelson, 32, admits killing Jordan Maguire, 20, at his Luton home, in a ""spree of violence"" on 26 May 2013 but claims it was done in self-defence.
The former resident of Marsh Farm Estate in Luton has pleaded not guilty to murder, rape and sexual assault.
A man who saw Mr Maguire stabbed three times said the accused ""showed no regrets or remorse"" afterwards.
Luton Crown Court heard the attacks happened at Mr Maguire's home in Thrales Close between 18:00 and 20:15.
The prosecution allege Mr Nelson was in the middle of a spree of violence, having sexually assaulted a 25-year-old woman in the stairway of some flats and then a 60-year-old woman in her flat.
Witness Dennis Kamau said he and his girlfriend were looking to buy some cannabis when he came across Mr Nelson near the Nisa store on the estate.
He took the pair to Mr Maguire's home where the men entered the house while the woman stayed outside.
After the pair agreed to share a deal, they went to the kitchen where Mr Maguire removed a tin from a kitchen cabinet.
Mr Kamau said: ""The next thing I saw was a knife rise above and attack Jordan.
""I saw the knife go into Jordan. Jordan acted all shocked. He stabbed him a second time.""
Mr Kamau told the jury the victim was then stabbed in the back by Mr Nelson who said ""You little pussy"" before putting the knife away and riding off on his bike.
""I was scared, terrified and shocked,"" said Mr Kamau.
Asked how the accused appeared, he said: ""He showed no regrets or remorse.""
A stab wound to the chest had punctured Mr Maguire's aorta and he was fatally injured.
The jury earlier heard Mr Nelson stayed for two weeks with a girlfriend in Ipswich before flying to his native Grenada and was later arrested in Trinidad.","A man who stabbed a drug dealer to death showed no remorse after the knife went in, a jury has heard."

Together with the Ben Burtt-designed whistles and beeps that are Artoo's voice, it made the droid as real a character as any other in the saga - human or alien.
We were all also able to relate to Artoo; here was a character who bickered with his friend C-3PO, occasionally manipulated those around him and displayed his courage when necessary.

The 3ft 8in (1.12m) actor was in a joint theatrical act called the Mini Tones with friend Jack Purvis, and the duo had just made the final of talent show Opportunity Knocks, so Baker left the Star Wars team.
""There was minor panic because there wasn't anybody else who could make the scale right and if we didn't have R2-D2 George didn't have a film, Star Wars wouldn't have been made,"" Mr Christian said.
Baker returned after the team agreed to employ Purvis as well.
Of the R2-D2 costume, Mr Christian said: ""Kenny was always complaining because it was difficult, it was so tight in there, we had to put rubber round him, foam rubber, and he couldn't move it, he could kind of shake it a bit, but that was about it...
""I found a fighter pilot's harness and we fitted that inside R2-D2 so Kenny could wear R2-D2 like a rucksack.
""And he actually stumbled forward about three steps and crashed over - we could hear him inside saying 'let me out!' But that was it.""
He added: ""He would endure it for hours and hours he was a good sportâ€¦ he would make jokes all the time.""
Baker's nephew, Drew Myerscough, said he had cared for Baker for ""eight or nine years"" after he developed respiratory problems.
He said his uncle, who lived in Preston, had a passion for wildlife documentaries and had ""a liking for lasagne"".
""He was just a normal, down-to-earth, regular guy that enjoyed life,"" he told the BBC, adding they ""rarely"" discussed Star Wars, adding: ""His fans worldwide kept him going and he loved nothing more than going to conventions and meeting everybody - it really gave him that extra lease of life.""
Other tributes came from Ewan McGregor, who played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the three Star Wars prequels, who tweeted: ""So sorry to hear about this. It was lovely working with Kenny.""
Actor Daniel Logan, who played Boba Fett in 2002's Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, added: ""So sad to hear one of my dearest friends passed away. Rest in peace Kenny Baker. Love you. Will miss you!""
David Prowse, who played Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy, tweeted: ""Very sorry to hear about Kenny. He was a great personal friend that I thoroughly enjoyed working with. #KennyBaker""
Actor Warwick Davis, who played characters in three Star Wars films, tweeted: ""#RIP #KennyBaker. Sad to say goodbye to a small man with a huge heart & personality. He paved the way for short actors of a generation. x""
Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said: ""There is no Star Wars without R2-D2, and Kenny defined who R2-D2 was and is.""
Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro, who directed Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth, simply tweeted: ""R.I.P Kenny Baker,"" while Clerks director Kevin Smith said: ""Rest in Peace @starwars legend #KennyBaker - whose name I learned at age 7 because he brought #R2D2 to life. Feels like losing family...""
The studio behind the original Star Wars films, 20th Century Fox, posted a still of R2-D2 and C-3PO and said: ""Rest in peace, Kenny Baker, the heart and soul of R2-D2.""
Actress Morgan Fairchild, who appeared in the 1987 film Sleeping Beauty with Baker, tweeted: ""Hate to hear this -lovely man-lovely soul.""
After starring in the original Star Wars, Baker he went on to appear in the sequels, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, and the three prequels between 1999 and 2005.
He was a consultant on last year's Star Wars: The Force Awakens but British actor Jimmy Vee was already lined up to take on the role of R2-D2 in the next film, due for release in 2017.

23130281,"The first bird emerged at the Cors Dyfi reserve near Machynlleth on Friday, followed by a second on Sunday.
The eggs were laid six weeks later than usual leading to concerns over whether the chicks would hatch.
Parents Monty and Glesni set up home on a 30ft (9m) tall man-made nest on 3 May.
They are one of only two known breeding pairs in Wales, with a second pair nesting near Croesor in the Glaslyn Valley.
Staff and volunteers at the Cors Dyfi nature reserve had an anxious wait for the chicks who took 32 hours to emerge from their shells.
Cracks in the first egg were spotted on Friday afternoon, with the bird finally hatching at about 21:00 BST.
The second chick started chipping away from inside its egg on Saturday afternoon but did not hatch until 20:40 BST on Sunday.
Monty and Glesni became a breeding pair for the first time this year after Monty's previous partner of two years, Nora, did not return from her African migration.
Ospreys return from migration in late March or April and usually lay eggs two or three weeks later.
But Monty and Glesni did not pair until 3 May and their two eggs were laid between 22 and 25 May - six weeks later than average.
Alwyn Evans, of Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, said: ""By the time Monty finally paired off with his new partner, Glesni, a three-year-old bird from Rutland Water, it was getting late in the season.
""At that stage none of us knew if they would lay eggs, let alone whether they would hatch.
""It's been an emotional weekend to say the least.""
Mr Evans said cracks in the second egg on Saturday were greeted with loud applause and shouting from visitors at the wildlife trust's osprey centre who had gathered to watch the birds hatch.
Last month the wildlife trust said ospreys were still persecuted and egg collecting remained a problem in the UK.
To protect the Powys eggs, more than 50 trust volunteers have worked 1,300 hours to ensure the nest has been watched 24 hours a day during the six-week incubation period.
The first osprey chick in the Dyfi valley for 400 years hatched in 2011.
Once prolific birds of prey in the UK, their numbers were drastically reduced in the 1840s after years of persecution, including egg collecting, hunting, taxidermy and loss of habitat.
The Dyfi Osprey Project has been popular with tourists, with an average of about 30,000 people visiting the nesting site annually.",Two osprey chicks have hatched at a nature reserve in Powys despite fears their parents had paired up too late in the mating season.
39043453,"Falcons twice led through Vereniki Goneva and Rob Vickers tries, with James Short and Harry Williams replying to level before a Simmonds penalty put Chiefs 17-14 up at the break.
Simmonds landed his fourth kick to convert a second-half penalty try.
A Sam Skinner score and a second Short effort ensured the bonus-point victory.
The win lifts them to within a point of leaders Wasps, who face Gloucester on Sunday.
For 20-year-old fly-half Simmonds, it was the perfect day with the boot as he replaced injured veteran Gareth Steenson in a side that was missing a number of players - including England's Jack Nowell and Henry Slade - due to Six Nations duties.
Newcastle, who a week earlier earned an impressive 46-31 win over Northampton at Kingston Park, made a strong start with Goneva crossing for a superb try, which started with a bustling run from Calum Green.
Short, who would finish the day by touching down for the fifth time in two games, restored parity for the first time with a 90-metre effort, which came from an error as Newcastle closed in on a second try.
While Exeter were made to work hard for their first-half lead after Vickers again edged Falcons ahead, the hosts were more ruthless after the break and heavily restricted Newcastle, who are still without a win at Sandy Park.
Exeter Chiefs assistant coach Ali Hepher:
""Newcastle are a good side and in good form and came here with a good deal of confidence but we started poorly, especially in defence.
""We were hesitant in that first half particularly when we had ball in hand as we needed to run hard instead of trying the clever ball.
""There was plenty to address at half-time but our defence was outstanding in that second half and to earn a bonus point was invaluable.
""Moving one point into second and above Saracens at this stage is not important as the top four places are really tight but we are hoping to remain there and to secure a top two finish would be really nice.""
Newcastle Falcons director of rugby Dean Richards:
""I'm disappointed as we started really well but we weren't accurate enough and this allowed them back into the game.
""We should have been further in front but we didn't take our chances and too many kicks went straight into touch.
""They are very good side, who are incredibly patient, as they wait for a chink in your defence before striking.""

36092074,"In mathematical terms it means that he has ridden more winners than any other jockey this season. In the context of horse racing, and sport in general, it is a triumph of commitment and perseverance which may never be rivalled.
Johnson has been trying to win it since the 1990s. It is his curse, and his blessing, that his career coincided with Sir Anthony (AP) McCoy. For 20 years in succession McCoy was champion. Throughout that time, almost every year, the man who finished behind him in second place was Richard Johnson.
I met up with Richard Johnson in Somerset at the yard of trainer Philip Hobbs - their relationship has been an important part of the jockey's career.
At 7.30 on an April morning Johnson was helping to school a group of the yard's horses, taking them over hurdles and fences on a field high above the Bristol Channel. In racing this might be termed 'work' but for Johnson, even at 38 years of age, he insists it is still pleasure.
""This is all I've ever wanted to do so it's not a job. Unfortunately I'm going to have to get a job one day when I have to stop doing it, but genuinely you love doing it. I think the 'job' is the driving round, the long days, but riding the horses is the fun bit,"" he said.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""But for me being champion jockey was the thing I've always wanted to do since I was a child growing up. So I suppose actually to reach that goal is always what I wanted to do and there's a lot of satisfaction.
""When AP McCoy retired at the end of last year I sort of thought, well I should be able to have a good chance at it. But there was a pressure. If I don't become champion jockey now maybe I'll not achieve what I wanted to. But the season's been absolutely amazing. My agent Dave Roberts works tirelessly to keep me busy and sends me round the country on a daily basis to hopefully achieve what I have.""
Roberts was McCoy's agent too and in simple terms Johnson has picked up rides this year which may have previously gone to McCoy. It's helped him dominate the Jockeys' Championship.
In the history of jump racing McCoy is the only man to have ridden more than 4,000 winners. But only one other jockey has gone past 3,000 winners, and that's Johnson.
When McCoy was riding in his first championship winning season in 1995, Johnson was in his first year as a conditional, or apprentice, jockey. For two decades they were in each other's company on almost a daily basis. The relationship was simultaneously bitter rivalry and deep appreciation.
Johnson said: ""I used to tell him regularly, you'd get to Christmas, I'd say to AP, 'just go on holiday for a couple of months, give me a bit more of a chance!' With our sport you can win the Gold Cup or the Grand National one day and unfortunately half an hour later you can be sat on your bum nursing an injury. You never know what's going to happen.
""We work with each other on a daily basis so after the race you're concerned that everyone came back in one piece and you can all have another go in half an hours' time.""
""I'm sure in my twenties I got very frustrated with AP, I felt however hard I tried or however great a week I had he'd always have a better one. I'm sure I got frustrated, not really with him but just that it didn't seem to matter how hard I tried. I didn't seem to be able to bridge the gap.
""But as you get older you become a little more realistic and you know you've just got to give 100% and hopefully you'll get your chance. This year it's a shame AP isn't still riding because it would be great to beat him but it doesn't take the shine off it for me, for me this is always what I've wanted to do.""
There is a new trophy for this year's champion jockey. The trophy was fashioned by Asprey's jewellers but the design was selected by McCoy. Furthermore, the man who placed it in Johnson's hands was none other than McCoy himself.
""I couldn't be happier about who I'm presenting it to,"" said the retired champion.
""He is someone who made me achieve what I achieved for so long and I think it's thoroughly deserved for his great work and his hard work and dedication for the last 20 odd years. I think it shows perseverance can always come good in the end.""
The experience of competing for so long against McCoy has shaped Johnson's approach to the sport. He feels the presence of his great rival even though he's retired.
""We were both probably greedy and wanted as many winners as each other and I think we probably pushed each other to do the best we could,"" added Johnson.
""I think even though he's retired, in my mind I'm still convinced I've got to give it everything every day of the week to make sure you get what you're looking for.""
Even though jump racing is split into seasons it is basically never-ending. The new campaign starts the week after the old one ends and there's the Punchestown Festival in Ireland between.
Johnson anticipates a grand total of two days off. But there is, he claims, no prospect of his enthusiasm wavering. Just the opposite in fact.
""I'm lucky in the fact that I'm probably a little bit smaller than AP was, I don't struggle quite as much with my weight so that's definitely a bonus for me and I'm a few years younger. I'm loving doing what I'm doing,"" he said.
""This is where I've always wanted to be so I'm not going to suddenly decide to give up now. The support I've had obviously off Philip Hobbs and his owners has been fantastic. But, again, there's been lots of other trainers I ride for, there's too many trainers to even mention.
""I'm not sure if people just feel sorry for the old man, but look, going to every race meeting whether it's a Monday at Catterick or Plumpton or Cheltenham or Aintree, the support I've had from everyone in racing, but also the general public, has just been fantastic. I must admit I'm slightly overwhelmed by the whole thing. I can't get over the support and it's given me the best year of my life.""
Jockeys often speak of the all-consuming nature of their sport, the excitement and engagement of racing which is irreplaceable. With that in mind I ask Johnson, with a smile, if he thinks there is a chance that McCoy might make a comeback.
He answers with humour, typically, intact.
""I hope not. He was looking quite healthy at the Grand National meeting so I'm hoping he's put too much weight on now and he'll stay where he is.""","On Saturday at Sandown, Richard Johnson lifted the trophy confirming that he is jump racing's champion jockey."

It also brings the definition of a caravan into line with the rest of the UK.
The Private Members Bill was sponsored by UUP MLA, John McAllister.

31292963,"It was back in 2008, and the young Indian woman was in Paris studying to be a pastry chef.
When her college friends realised that she had never tasted a macaron - a small, colourful circular cake made from ground almonds and filled with cream or icing - they whisked her to one of the best macaron shops in the French capital.
After just one bite, Ms Dhingra decided there and then that when she returned to Mumbai she would open her own macaron store, the first of its kind in India.
""This might sound dramatic, but I realised that yes, this is what I want to do, I want to go back to India and take macarons with me. This was my mission,"" she says.
Fast forward seven years, and Ms Dhingra, now 28, is the owner of three busy macaron shops in Mumbai. Another three stores will open in the city this year, and she has plans to expand her business, Le 15 Patisserie, across the country.
Yet as a young businesswoman in India, she says it hasn't always been plain sailing.
Ms Dhingra should have been a lawyer. But while studying law at university in Mumbai, she decided that she wanted to quit to do something more creative.
Remembering helping her mother in the kitchen during her childhood, she decided to work with food instead of legal cases.
So she convinced her parents to let her go to Switzerland to study hospitality and management.
After three years at a Swiss catering college, Ms Dhingra did one year at the well-known Le Cordon Bleu school in Paris.
Returning to Mumbai upon graduation, she set to work in her parents' kitchen on developing her own macaron recipe.
Yet with the weather in Mumbai being substantially hotter and more humid than Paris, she struggled for half a year, as the heat and humidity makes it difficult to make the delicate cakes.
""When I started making macarons, first at my home kitchen, it was a complete disaster,"" she says.
""It took me around six months of research and 60 failed recipes to finally get something right.""
When she finally had a recipe she was proud of, her businessman father agreed to invest the initial funds she required to set up the business.
Yet being both young and female meant she faced additional challenges.
""The biggest problem was to get people to take you seriously,"" she says. ""For example, if I had to sign a lease for a place, or buy machinery, I would have to ask my father to make these calls for me.""
Ms Dhingra also found it difficult to deal with Indian red tape.
""My education in Switzerland, and working in hotels there, gave me a good idea of what working in hospitality would be like, but dealing with the bureaucracy is extremely difficult when starting a business in India.""
The Boss is a series profiling entrepreneurs from around the world.
However, she eventually secured the premises for a small commercial kitchen in 2010, and began hiring and training staff. The first shop soon followed.
She named the business Le 15 Patisserie after the 15th arrondissement or area of Paris, where she lived during her time in the French capital.
To start to build up sales in a city where very few people knew what a macaron was, let alone have tried one, Ms Dhingra concentrated on giving away free samples.
The cakes were immediately popular, and sales soon took off thanks to positive word of mouth.
Ms Dhingra also started running classes on how to make macarons and other cakes, which gave the business a further promotional boost.
She has also since released a cookery book, which has been a best-seller in India.
One newspaper article called her ""the macaron queen of India"".
As she plans the expansion of her business, Ms Dhingra is keen to stress that she has had no additional money from her parents since her father's initial investment.
The world is getting wealthier - but with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, who are the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015?

Instead, she says she has grown the business by reinvesting profits, and taking out bank loans. The shops now sell both macarons and other types of cakes, and the business employs 40 people in total.
After seeing her success, a number of other people have now set up rival macaron shops in Mumbai, but Ms Dhingra says she doesn't mind the competition.
""People can only copy what you have done, no-one can copy your ideas and vision. So I like it [the competition], it keeps me on my feet, and we always push our boundaries so that we can always stay a step ahead.""
She urges other young women, both in India and overseas, to also start their own companies.
""Once you are passionate about what you want to do you will achieve it,"" she says. ""The hours will be long and challenges will appear, but if you are passionate enough you will succeed.""",When Pooja Dhingra tasted her first macaron she immediately knew what she wanted to do with her life.

A German television documentary claimed to present evidence of systematic doping and corruption in Russian sport.
IAAF chief Lamine Diack told BBC Sport athletics is ""in crisis"" but said ""90% to 95%"" of athletes are clean.
Meadows, 33, was beaten to European gold by a Russian drug cheat in 2011.
German television station WDR broadcast three documentaries alleging that 99% of Russian athletes are doping and that IAAF officials were implicated in covering it up.
The claims have been rejected as a ""pack of lies"" by the Russian Athletics Federation and Diack told BBC Sport that the figure was ""a joke"" and ""ridiculous"".
Meadows, from Wigan, said: ""If it is as widespread as those allegations do deem, I just think it would just kill our sport.
""Sponsors may walk away from the sport and fans may walk away from the sport. We may never get a 100% accuracy of the scale of doping.

In 2011 Meadows finished second in the 800m to Yevgeniya Zinurova in the European Indoor Championships, only to be upgraded to gold the following year when the Russian was banned for two years for doping.
Meadows added: ""It might be the case that we have to prove how many people are doping, destroy the image of the sport and then rebuild it again and look for positive role models who can succeed and win medals on the international stage who are clean athletes.""

38807942,"Rising energy prices pushed inflation to 1.8% in January, a near four-year high and up from 1.1% in December.
Eurostat data also showed the jobless rate fell to 9.6% in December, the lowest rate since May 2009.
GDP growth edged up to 0.5% in the final three months of 2016, up from 0.4% in the previous quarter.
The rise in eurozone inflation last month was driven by an 8.1% jump in energy prices in January compared with the year before.
The spike in the rate takes it up to the European Central Bank's inflation target of close to, but below, 2%.
Some have called for the European Central Bank to further scale back its bond-buying programme.
However, the ECB also looks at core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food prices, in its policy decisions, and this rate remained unchanged at 0.9% in January.
In December, the ECB said it would buy bonds worth 60bn euros a month from April. The 80bn euro-a-month quantitative easing scheme had been due to end in March, but was expected to be extended.
The stimulus programme was an effort to increase the supply of money in the economic bloc to keep interest rates low, and encourage borrowing and spending.
The European Central Bank's key job is to maintain ""price stability"" in the Eurozone, which it interprets as inflation of below but close to 2%.
For the last few years it has been wrestling with inflation that its governing council considers too low, at times even below zero - a situation of deflation or falling prices.
That has led the bank to choose very unusual policies intended to stimulate prices rises - ultra-low interest rates (one of its rates is negative) and quantitative easing, buying financial assets with newly created money.
So with inflation now at 1.8%, pretty much in line with the target, is that job done? Time to turn the policy taps off?
Not necessarily. The rise in inflation is down to higher food and especially energy prices. The impact of those factors is likely to fade and other price rises are still relatively slow.
There are different views in the ECB's governing council but the majority are not likely to be in a hurry to get policy back to normal.
The eurozone's unemployment rate of 9.6% in December was down from 9.7% in November and  compares with a rate of 10.5% a year earlier.
The countries with the lowest unemployment rates in December were the Czech Republic (3.5%) and Germany (3.9%), while countries with the highest levels of unemployment were Greece (23.0% in October 2016) and Spain (18.4%).
Despite the pick-up in economic growth during the final quarter of 2016, across the year as a whole eurozone GDP rose by 1.7%, which was down from 2% in 2015.
Analysts also questioned whether the recent improvement could be sustained.
""While recent economic news points to improved growth, we suspect the eurozone may find it difficult to sustain this momentum amid appreciable political uncertainties during 2017 and likely reduced consumer purchasing power due to higher inflation,"" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight.
""Consequently, we suspect that eurozone GDP growth in 2017 will be no more than 1.6%. We also see growth at 1.6% in 2018.""",The eurozone's economy is showing signs of recovery after the latest data pointed to a fall in unemployment while growth and inflation picked up.
40497411,"Peter Lloyd, 45, lives in a tent in the garden of an ""uninhabitable"" house, Cardiff Civil Justice Centre heard.
Mr Lloyd, who has electromagnetic hypersensitivity, said he was entitled to direct payments to employ a helper.
The council, which was ordered to pay Â£12,000 in costs, had claimed he was not capable of managing money.
Quashing the council's decision on Wednesday, Mr Justice Singh said electromagnetic hypersensitivity was not a recognised condition in the UK.
He added it was ""not a matter for the court to say what the decision would have been if the authority went about its decision correctly"".
Direct payments are given to individuals by councils so they can buy help or services instead of having them supplied by the authority.
Mr Lloyd lives in the back garden of a privately-owned home in Thornhill and has refused alternative accommodation and a portable toilet, the court heard.
He urinates in plastic bottles and defecates in bed pans lined with black bin bags.
He has no running water and an insurance company deemed the house uninhabitable after flooding and the discovery of asbestos - although that has since been removed.
When council workers went to collect Mr Lloyd's waste in May, they found 90 litres of urine and 40 bags of faeces.
He has meals delivered five times a week, including supplies for the weekend on a Friday. As he has no fridge, he has to have food which will not go off.
Representing Mr Lloyd, Christian Howells said: ""Where he lives has to be adapted because the symptoms are very real to him.""
He described the situation as ""chicken and egg"" - Mr Lloyd wants the money to pay for help to improve his day-to-day life but the council felt he was not in a position to be given the funds.
Rebecca Stickler, for the council, said: ""The housing department has offered housing in a field and various properties and he has refused them all.
""It can't possibly be the case that a local authority should be compelled to use the public purse to pay money to someone who they know cannot manage that payment.""
Mr Lloyd's private landlord has begun eviction proceedings in county court, he is estranged from his family and the council recognises him as homeless.
Speaking after the hearing, councillor Susan Elsmore, cabinet member for social care, health and wellbeing, insisted the council had never said Mr Lloyd was not capable of managing money.

Ainslie, 35, admits it would have been ""difficult to top"" the feeling of winning at his home Olympics and is keen to move on with new challenges.
""It was a tough decision,"" Ainslie told BBC Sport.
""I've had a fantastic Olympic career but I want to make it clear that the focus is now on the Americas Cup.""
Ainslie won a silver medal at Atlanta 1996, with golds in Sydney, Athens, Beijing and London. He has won more medals than any other sailor, ahead of Denmark's Paul Elvstrom, who has four golds.
He is fourth in Britain's all-time individual medallist's list, behind Sir Chris Hoy (cycling; six gold, one silver), Sir Steve Redgrave (rowing; five gold, one bronze) and Bradley Wiggins (cycling; four gold, one silver, two bronze).

Ainslie added: ""I considered all of the factors - my fitness and the issues with my back, the venue for the next Olympics and the type of boats, but what it really came down to was this opportunity with the Americas Cup.""
The sailor envisages skippering his Ben Ainslie Racing AC45 catamaran to glory in the historic competition will be one of the ""biggest tests"" of his career.
""It's always been a dream of mine since I was a kid to be part of a winning Americas Cup team and ultimately I want to try and bring it back to the UK where it all started in 1851.""
Ainslie, who won his first Games medal - a silver in the Laser fleet - at Atlanta 1996, says he may have extended his Olympic career into a twentieth year had the International Sailing Federation [ISAF] reversed their decision to axe the Star class from Rio 2016.
""There was a possibility that it may have been reinstated, but that didn't happen,"" reflected the four-time World Sailor of the Year Award winner.
""There would have been no guarantees I would have made it to the Olympics going up against 2008 gold medallists Iain [Percy] and Andrew [Simpson], but certainly it was an option to go into that class.""
Ainslie ranked his success in London as his greatest personal Olympic moment, but that attaining a first gold at the Sydney 2000 Games was a close second.
""It meant a huge amount to me to reverse the silver medal from 1996 and it gave me a huge amount of confidence that I could go on and achieve more,"" stated Ainslie who switched from the Laser to the Finn dinghy for Athens 2004.
""I am proud of what I achieved [in the Olympics] but I think this decision [to retire from dinghy sailing] really helps to make it clear what the goal is and the intensions are.

41014624,"GCSE results are being changed to grades 9 to 1, with the first such grades to be published this week.
But there will be two different pass marks - grade 4 as a ""standard"" pass and grade 5 as a ""strong"" pass.
Researchers say pupils need to be at grade 5 to match global rivals.
The study from the Education Policy Institute says England's school system faces an ""immense challenge"" if it is going to match the levels of achievement in countries such as Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan.
GCSEs in England are being made more challenging and will be decided by final exams rather than coursework, with the first results of these new-style GCSEs being published for English and maths this week.
These will be graded from 9 to 1, with a grade 4 being counted as a ""standard"" pass, similar to a grade C.
But the researchers say that on average pupils should be achieving a ""strong"" pass at grade 5, if England is going to keep up with international competitors.
At present, the researchers say, only 40% of pupils in state schools have reached this ""world-class standard"".
To keep up in maths, the study says, it would require an increase of over a third of pupils getting top grades and an average above grade 5.
""The old C grade is not an adequate national aspiration if England wants to compete with top education nations,"" says David Laws, former Education Minister and executive chairman of the Education Policy Institute.
""This analysis highlights the gulf between education outcomes in England and the performance of the world's best education nations,"" he said.
""In certain subjects, such as maths, England needs both to significantly raise the number of top performers and almost halve the number of low performers if it is to compete with the world's best.""
Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers said: ""This report shows that England's obsession with structural change, under a succession of governments, has had little impact on either standards or equity.
""Policy makers have routinely pursued the wrong priorities,"" said Mr Whiteman.
""The highest performing school systems are those that invest in their teachers and that respect and value education.""
Kevin Courtney, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said that even if the overall results at national level were kept in line with previous years, individual schools ""will still experience volatility in their results"".
He warned that such volatility could have ""unfair consequences"".
There have been warnings about confusion over having two pass grades - with universities using different versions of a pass in their entry requirements.
Education Secretary Justine Greening had explained the plans for two pass grades to the education select committee earlier this year.
""I want to provide certainty about how this new grading will work and, in particular, the consequences for individual pupils of achieving a grade 4 or grade 5,"" Ms Greening had written to the committee chairman.
""Rather than reporting on the ""good pass"", we will instead distinguish between a grade 4 as a ""standard pass"" and a grade 5 as a ""strong pass"" and report on both.""
A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We know there is more to do and this report underlines the importance of our reforms to create new gold-standard GCSEs, benchmarked against the best education systems in the world so young people learn the knowledge and skills that will allow them to compete in an increasingly global workplace.""","Pass marks for GCSEs in England need to be pushed upwards to catch up with high performing education systems in Asia, say researchers from the Education Policy Institute."
35585467,"The Shadow Man, and a Christmas poem called Noel, were found at Our Lady's School, Abingdon.
It is thought Tolkien got to know the school while he was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University.
The poems were printed a year before Tolkien's first literary sensation The Hobbit was published.
The Shadow Man is an earlier version of a poem eventually published in 1962 in Tolkien's Adventures of Tom Bombadil collection.
The existence of the poems came to light after American Tolkien scholar Wayne G. Hammond got in touch with the school.
He knew from notes made by Tolkien that two of his poems appeared in a magazine he called The Abingdon Chronicle.
This was actually the 1936 annual of Our Lady's School, which was then run by the Sisters of Mercy.
School principal Stephen Oliver said: ""At first we couldn't find the 1936 edition and referred Mr Hammond to the archives of the Sisters of Mercy in London.
""Then, while preparing for an event for former pupils of the school, we uncovered our own copy and I saw the two poems Mr Hammond had been looking for. ""

Mr Rouhani won Friday's presidential election in the first round.
He promised voters a moderate and outward-looking Iran and criticised the conservative-dominated judiciary.
Council elections were held alongside the presidential vote and the results were announced on Sunday.
The new city council must convene within 45 days when it will elect a new mayor to oversee services for Tehran's nine million residents.
Incumbent Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf was a candidate in the early stages of the presidential election but dropped out to back hardliner Ebrahim Raisi.
Mr Raisi only received 38.5% of the vote, which was not enough to take the election to a second round.
President Rouhani, 68, said his resounding victory showed that voters rejected extremism and wanted more links with the outside world.
Analysts say he is in a strong position to seek reforms and to revive Iran's ailing economy.

39500675,"Kylle Godfrey is subject to a Criminal Behaviour Order which means he must tell police of any relationship lasting more than 14 days.
Shira told the BBC she hoped it would make him ""think twice before getting into a relationship"".
Godfrey, 30, is currently serving a three-year prison sentence.
It is believed to be the first time in England and Wales such an order has been made.
Shira - who did not want to disclose her full name - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the abuse started shortly after they met in 2011.
""The first incident was a few months after we met and it started over the phone. I thought he was being overprotective but he was really being jealous.
""He was constantly checking on me on the phone, being paranoid and accusing me of things all the time.""
Over time, she said, Godfrey became ""more and more"" violent.
""I went through hell with him physically, mentally and emotionally, and now I can see I risked my life with him.""
On one occasion she remembers him ""smashing my head on the floor four or five times"".
""I thought 'I'm going to die.'
""I just had a little pray, and I realised no-one deserves to be in that position. My life is more important than this.""
Godfrey's Criminal Behaviour Order - which lasts for seven years - also allows police to inform future partners of his previous violent behaviour to women, under the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme.
Shira said the order ""makes me feel more safe, and other women will be protected"".
""Instead of us women trying to prevent them [from being abusive], they have to go away from us.""
""The emphasis is on the perpetrator, not the victim.""
Shira said she now hopes Godfrey ""will think twice before getting into a relationship"".
""It's also good for me and my children, this order, as it will help us know where he is and what he's doing - to protect ourselves.""
Godfrey could be jailed if he breaches the terms of the order.
He was jailed on 14 February after admitting to two counts of actual bodily harm, perverting the course of justice and witness intimidation.
A court heard how over several days in October last year, he attacked his ex-partner, banging her head on the floor and grabbing her around the throat.
Following his arrest, Godfrey continued to intimidate the woman and, while on bail, assaulted another woman he had started a new relationship with.
Shira said she felt ""relief"" at the sentencing.
""Now I can just concentrate on just moving on.
""No-one deserves to [suffer] domestic violence… especially women with children.""
Detective Inspector Jane Topping, of the Met Police's Hackney Community Safety Unit, said the order ""gives us a new way of protecting victims of domestic abuse and prevent other women from suffering at the hands of people like Godfrey, and help our efforts to tackle domestic violence"".
""The victim in Godfrey's case was subjected to a horrendous ordeal by him following a sustained campaign of domestic violence. She has shown incredible bravery in supporting our investigation.""

38951701,"Business and political circles in Switzerland had supported the plan, which was designed to prevent taxes rising sharply for foreign investors.
However 59% of voters opposed the plan in Sunday's referendum vote.
The government will now need to find an alternative, which may involve higher tax rates for multinational companies.
""It will not be possible to find a solution overnight,"" said Ueli Maurer, Switzerland's finance minister. He told a press conference it could take a year to come up with a new plan, and that Switzerland risked losing foreign investment as a result.
Currently Switzerland grants special status to foreign firms which allows cantons, or districts, to offer them lower rates of tax than domestic firms, making Switzerland an attractive destination for foreign investors.
But international organisations such as the OECD have deemed the system unacceptable and Switzerland has made a commitment to reform it by 2019.
To avoid raising taxes for multinational companies too sharply the government had agreed to abolish the special status for multinationals but instead offer new tax breaks for research and development and other activities.
As part of the proposal, Switzerland's cantons planned to lower their tax rates for businesses across the board, including domestic business, helping to avoid steep rises in tax bills when foreign firms' status was brought into line.
Some of the resulting budget shortfall in the cantons would have been plugged by federal funds.
But the plan was opposed by Social Democrats, Greens, trade unions and churches who argued that the reduced tax revenue would still lead to cuts in public services or higher personal taxes.
""The conservative parties wanted to push through tax reform with arrogance and haughtiness against the interests of the people. The Greens demand a new proposal with a sense of proportion,"" the opposition leftist party said of the vote.","Swiss voters have rejected a plan to reform the country's corporate tax system, sending the government back to the drawing board."
39519844,"How much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why.
It used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier.
This is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows.
Then we had the financial crisis of 2008.
The upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them.
For example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of £27,000 at the age of 28, compared with £28,000 for those born in the 1970s.
The figure was £21,000 for those born in the 1960s and £15,000 for those born in the 1950s.
Despite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age.
By their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about £27,000 each, on average.
By the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - £53,000 each.
A large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither.
At the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s.
Home ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30.
Similarly, the Local Government Association reported in December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago.
The lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices.
In their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs.
At the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by the decline of social housing.
For today's renters, it seems likely that raising a deposit is a greater barrier to home ownership than actually paying a mortgage.
Lower interest rates mean housing costs for young homeowners have fallen and they are quite likely to be paying much less than renters relative to their incomes. Mortgage interest costs for homeowners born in the early 1980s amounted to just 15% of income.
Of course, the low interest rates that have benefitted homeowners are themselves likely to be one of the factors pushing up house prices.
The vast majority of young adults working in the private sector will never have pensions as generous as those enjoyed by their older colleagues.
This is because most employers have closed defined benefits pension schemes, which typically see employees paid a set proportion of their average or final salary when they retire.
The schemes that have replaced them are typically much less generous.
In their early thirties, fewer than one in 10 private sector employees born in the early 1980s were active members of a defined benefit scheme.
This compares with nearly four out of 10 workers born in the 1960s.
In 2015, 90% of those in defined benefit schemes received an employer contribution equivalent to 10% of their earnings or more, compared with only 13% of those in other schemes.
With stalled incomes, lower home ownership and less generous pensions, it is easy to see that young adults have little to cheer about financially.
But those older, wealthier, generations are increasingly seen as the ones likely to provide a secure future.
Of those people born in the 1970s, 75% have either received or expect to receive an inheritance.
This figure has grown steadily over the decades and has doubled since the 1930s, when just 38% of people expected an inheritance.
Our data doesn't allow us to look at those born in the 1980s or 90s, but there is no reason to think this trend has not continued.
Within each generation, most inherited wealth goes to those who are already comparatively well-off.
Among the 1970s generation, nine out of 10 people whose income is in the top 20% have received or expect to receive an inheritance.
This compares with six out of 10 among those whose income is in the bottom 20%.
Data is not yet available for those born in the 80s or 90s.
So, for all the attention on inequality between generations, family ties mean a large chunk of the wealth held by older generations is likely to flow down to younger generations.
But most of that wealth will flow to those who are already well-off, potentially widening inequality within the younger generation.
It looks like we're heading for a future where how much wealth your parents have matters more than it used to.

35699837,"Nonsuch Palace was painted by the Flemish artist Joris Hoefnagel in 1568.
Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has placed a temporary export bar on the watercolour in the hope a UK buyer can match the asking price of £1m.
""We have very few paintings of the palace so I really hope we can find a buyer to keep this masterpiece here in Britain,"" he said.
The piece is the oldest of six remaining depictions of the palace, considered to be one of the Renaissance period's most stunning buildings.
Nonsuch Palace - named because no other palace could equal it - was built in 1538 for the Tudor king to celebrate the birth of his first legitimate son and mark his 30th year on the throne,
It was intended to rival the opulent residences of French king Francis I.
In 1670 Charles II gave the palace to his mistress, Barbara Villiers, who began to dismantle and sell parts of the building to pay off gambling debts.
By 1690 the building had all but disappeared.
The painting went for auction in 2010 but failed to meet its reserve price of £1.2m.
The decision to defer the export licence follows a recommendation by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA), administered by Arts Council England.
They made their recommendation on the grounds of its close association with our history and national life, its outstanding aesthetic importance and its outstanding significance for understanding the nature of English Renaissance architecture.

But bookmakers won't have lost out overall, admits Ladbrokes' Alex Donohue.
Although Ladbrokes are losing £3m on Leicester this week, throughout the season a lot of bets were placed on the favourites, such as Chelsea and Manchester City, which will have more than cushioned the blow.
""£3m is a record net payout for a title winner, but we did well out of Leicester upsetting the odds to get there. No complaints at all,"" he tweeted.
Ladbrokes are ""by no means crying out in pain"" over the season in general, says Mr Donohue.
Bookmakers do best when a second or third favourite team wins the title, he says.
Title win an amazing feeling - Ranieri
Leicester 'can make £150m from PL title'
The greatest sporting story of all time?
The wearable tech giving sports teams winning ways
More importantly for bookmakers Leicester's win is a great story.
The bookmakers were much slower than the punters to believe that Leicester could win the title. The problem was not so much the long odds at the start of the season, but the fact that they were so slow to respond to Leicester's success.
At Christmas, when the Foxes were unbeaten for 10 games in a row, the odds were still quite high, in Coral's case they were still at 33-1 in December.
It wasn't until Leicester beat Manchester City 3-1 in February that they became favourites to win.
""The bookies were just ignoring their form. The punters started to believe but not the bookies,"" said Mr Clare.
""We've never lost money like this - it's the biggest hit we've ever taken. In a way it's a beautiful wake up call. It's an amazing moment.""
And there's a sound reason they are not downcast at their losses.  Next year they're expecting a great flood of new bets as fans from Burnley to Bournemouth hope that their team will ""do a Leicester"".
The odds on a Watford or a West Brom win are slight of course. Leicester's success was  a ""perfect storm of the right manager, right players, few injuries, no playing in Europe and the big teams underperforming"" says Dale Tempest from online betting firm Skybet.
Skybet, which sponsors the three divisions below the Premier League, has a particularly large base of Leicester supporters and is therefore one of the companies that stands to lose the most - in the region of £5m.
Interestingly, the bookmakers seem to think that the chances of Leicester being relegated are greater than them winning again.
Mr Tempest says that's because the stakes have been raised - there will be tempting offers for the top players, the big teams are looking to change managers and they'll have to play in Europe.
So has it made the industry more cautious?
Ladbrokes says no more 5,000-1 odds for the Premier League, Coral says it will be much more cautious.
But Skybet have got 5,000-1 odds for Burnley to win the Premier League, who have just won the Championship and will be promoted next season. Already, 888 people have placed their bets - meaning that if they win Skybet stand to lose £7m.
However, Mr Tempest says the company will be quicker to slash the odds should the team start performing, a sentiment echoed by all the companies.
But William Hill's Graham Sharpe says this is a numbers game. The chances of Leicester winning were that slim and they would probably do the same again - and the next 4,999 times they'll be right.
He likens it to the jockey Frankie Dettori riding the winning horse in all seven races at Ascot in 1996 - an unheard of feat. He remembers the stunned haze surrounding the bookies and their £40m loss.
But he says, it was so unlikely, that they all agreed they'd probably do the same again.
""This time we hold our hands up and say well done. But Ranieri, don't do it again,"" he says.
And as for Leigh Herbert - will he be doing it again?
""This is it for me. I mean... it's not going to happen again, so why carry on?""
I wonder if he will stick to that.",The betting industry is licking its financial wounds.

In a statement, Ben's mother, Joanne Treston-Smith, said: ""The void that Ben's death has left will never be filled. We will always have him missing in our lives.""
The court heard that the murder followed a feud between Michael Bagnall and the victim, who was going out with the Bagnall's ex-girlfriend.
Bagnall was said to have resented the new relationship and sent the girl ""threatening messages"" by phone or Facebook.

Ms Savell has been charged with aggravated battery by a firearm.
Bay County Sheriff's Office told the BBC the female victim had turned up with a male friend, whom she had just met in a bar, at the accused's home at around 01:00 local time on Monday.
Ms Savell told police her hospitality began to wear thin after her guests began drinking and raising their voices.
But instead of dropping a hint by yawning or loading the dishwasher, she armed herself with a 22-calibre handgun and shot at her guests' feet, officials said.
As well as shooting the woman, Kristy Jo Mohr, in both legs in the incident, and her companion, who went by name ""Cowboy"", Ms Savell's own boyfriend was struck by a bullet in the leg.

37012635,"Mr McMullin, the former chief policy director of the House Republican Conference, is expected to formally file his candidacy on Monday.
He is likely to face challenges on ballot deadlines and fundraising just three months before Election Day.
The 40-year-old Mormon has never held elected office.
Mr McMullin, an outspoken critic of the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, released a statement to ABC News.
""It's never too late to do the right thing, and America deserves much better than either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton can offer us. I humbly offer myself as a leader who can give millions of disaffected Americans a conservative choice for President,"" Mr McMullin said.
The little-known, unmarried conservative worked for the CIA for 11 years before leaving the agency in 2010.
He later went to work for Goldman Sachs and became a senior adviser on national security for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs in 2013.
Mr McMullin resigned from his position at the House Republican Conference on Monday, US media reported.
The Utah native graduated from Brigham Young University and earned a master's of business administration from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, according to his LinkedIn page.
He had just 135 Twitter follows when his pending candidacy was first announced and gained more than 12,000 within hours.
Mr McMullin has voiced his opposition to Mr Trump on social media, calling him an ""authoritarian"" and denouncing the Republican nominee's attacks on the family of fallen Capt. Humayan Khan.
In a Facebook post, Mr McMullin condemned Mr Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric, saying ""attacking them as a group makes America weaker, not stronger"".
Mr McMullin joins third-party candidates Libertarian Party's Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein, who are also in the race for the White House.
Mr McMullin faces a series of hurdles over the next three months, having already missed the deadlines to get on the ballot in 26 states.
He will have to collect tens of thousands of signatures in the coming days to make the 10 August deadline for several more states.
But the Morman candidate will have time to appear on the ballot in his native Utah, where Mr Trump is deeply unpopular among the Mormon electorate.
Senator Ted Cruz overwhelmingly defeated Mr Trump in Utah during the primary election, taking 69% of the vote to 14%.
Though Mr McMullin is not likely to appear on majority of state ballots across the country, he could block Mr Trump from taking the historically red state of Utah and peel off some of the billionaire's conservative voters.
Mr McMullin will also have to chase millions of dollars in donations over the next few weeks in order to keep up with his opponents this fall.
The group Better for America, which was formed by Never Trump conservatives, had been reportedly searching for an independent presidential candidate to put up against the nominee.
The group has insisted key Republican donors would throw their support behind his candidacy, according to ABC News.
Prominent Republican operative Rick Wilson is expected to help run Mr McMullin's campaign.
Mr Wilson wrote about why Mr Trump needs to ""suffer a humiliating defeat"" in a New York Daily News op-ed on Sunday.
He wrote: ""if there's a loss by a slim margin in the popular vote or electoral college, millions of already embittered Americans, worked into a frenzy by a shameless leader who will surely refuse to accept the returns, will start the next four years convinced that the United States of America is little more than a banana republic â€” and the presidency of Hillary Clinton is irretrievably illegitimate"".
Florida-based pollster and operative Joel Searby is also thought to be working on the campaign.
Mr McMullin's candidacy comes after the Never Trump movement talked of launching campaigns for Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse and National Review writer David French earlier this year.",Former CIA agent Evan McMullin has launched an independent campaign for the White House with support from members of the Never Trump movement.

""If they can't handle the influx of people in an efficient way so as not to cause this level of disruption on all the access routes around Shepton Mallet... then it should be stopped or limited to the number that can be processed efficiently,"" she added.
Frome MP David Warburton tweeted it had ""not been so bad for years"" and he would be writing to Mr Eavis as this was ""not good for Somerset"".

""Elizabeth Mort never imagined that the last thing she ate before giving birth to her daughter - a poppy seed bagel - would lead to the loss of her newborn, but that is exactly what happened after the Jameson Health System failed to account for the possibility that her positive urine drug screen was due to her ingestion of poppy seeds,"" the lawsuit said.
Child welfare officials arrived the day after the family returned from hospital with an emergency protective custody order and took Isabella.
She was later returned after the agency could find no evidence Ms Mort had used illegal drugs.
The lawsuit, which was filed on her behalf by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), was settled on Tuesday.
ACLU officials said Jameson had changed its policy to ensure newborns were not taken from parents solely on the basis of maternal drug test results.
""We hope that this case will encourage hospitals that routinely test pregnant women for drug use to reconsider that practice due to the harm that can result from false positives,"" said ACLU lawyer Sara Rose.","A US woman whose newborn was taken from her because she failed a hospital drug test after eating a poppy seed bagel has won a settlement, says her lawyer."
39512639,"Off the court, where she makes the bulk of her earnings, the question is - can she be as big a sponsor draw as she was before her enforced absence?
The 29-year-old will return to action on Wednesday, 26 April, in Stuttgart after being handed a wildcard.
Although some fellow players have expressed misgivings, she has the support of the WTA tour, and her fans.
And, with biggest commercial rival Serena Williams announcing she is pregnant and facing time away from the game, the Russian's return is certainly timely.
In the year from June 2015, Forbes estimates the five-time Grand Slam winner made $1.9m (Â£1.5m) in prize money from playing, but a whopping $20m from endorsements, a sum matched only by Williams.
And it is this primary source of earnings that Sharapova will be looking to reinvigorate.
""During her time out there will have been some continued relationship with her sponsors,"" says Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford.
""But I am sure there will have been some sort of penalty clause in her sponsor contracts for incurring a suspension.""
Following Sharapova's admission in March 2016 that she had tested positive for a banned drug at that year's Australian Open, she was initially banned by the International Tennis Federation for two years, later reduced on appeal.
But unlike golfer Tiger Woods, who haemorrhaged sponsors very quickly after his extra-marital affairs came to light, Sharapova's backers waited to see how things played out.
""That was because they had invested so much money and effort into their deals,"" says Prof Chadwick.
""Also, to terminate deals could have been dangerous as she might come back successfully, and if you as a sponsor have decided to cancel her contract then the door has been left wide open for a rival.""
As it was the sponsor reaction was mixed - Head and Evian were immediately supportive, Nike and Porsche put their relationships on hold but later came back on board, while Tag Heuer and Avon chose not to extend deals that had ended.
Given the large amounts of money and time invested - Nike's relationship with the player dates back to when she was 11 years old - it is not surprising the major brands wanted to think hard before reaching their decisions.
""In terms of brands and reputation, what all this has highlighted is that first of all Sharapova is a major brand in her own right,"" says Karen Earl, chairman of the European Sponsorship Association.
""She commands a lot of media attention, as the furore about her comeback demonstrates. It also highlights that she is a huge star, and that women's tennis feels it needs her.
""That is one of the reasons why brands want to continue to associate with her. Those that stuck with her value the association of her brand with their brands.""
Mrs Earl says the fact that Sharapova immediately put her hand up and admitted the drugs breach helped mitigate the damage to her brand, and those of her partners.
""Sharapova admitted she had done a wrong thing.
""She has gone out of her way to recognise what she has done and has handled that situation in a credible way. She has been contrite and said it will not happen again,"" says Mrs Earl.
""The fact there hasn't been a public outcry against her return will have reassured brands to stick with her.
""If there had been protests from tennis fans, then that might have influenced her sponsors' decisions.""
Prof Chadwick says Sharapova's management and advisers, those who look after her profile, grabbed hold of a difficult situation very quickly.
He believes the Russian is now pushing at an open door with regards to her return to the sport, with WTA boss Steve Simon quoted as saying: ""I believe that the game, the fans, the tour... everybody is going to welcome Maria back.""
Even before Serena Williams' pregnancy announcement, Prof Chadwick says that the sport was struggling to find an heir apparent at the top of the women's game.
""There is not a great deal of highest-quality talent following on behind,"" he says.
""Nobody seems to be able to string together a consistent run of results. Women's tennis needs all the help it can get in terms of heroes, big names, elite talent to attract fans to the sport.
""As a constellation of female tennis player brands, the sport has been somewhat diminished by Sharapova's absence.""
Mrs Earl points out that while many players have not taken too kindly to Sharapova's return, for her sponsors the important thing is the welcome she will receive from her fans, who are potential purchasers of their products.
""The sponsors are not endorsing her because she has been the most successful player, it is because of what she brings off the court,"" she says.
""Her persona and brand are what is most important. She knows how to market herself. She is commercially astute.
""To her credit, even after her time away, she is still probably the most marketable female tennis player.""",Maria Sharapova faces the biggest challenge of her tennis career - namely her return to the sport after a 15-month drugs ban -  and it is not just her continued sporting success that is in the spotlight.

12066494,"It puts new, lower limits on the size of each country's nuclear arsenal, and updates the verification mechanism.
There are limits on warheads and on launchers, which must be implemented within seven years of the treaty's entry into force.
Warheads: Under the New Start treaty each side is allowed a maximum of 1,550 warheads. This is about 30% lower than the figure of 2,200 that each side was meant to reach by 2012 under the Start treaty (as revised in the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty).
Launchers: Each country is allowed, in total, no more than 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear arms. Another 100 are allowed if they are not operationally deployed - for example, missiles removed from a sub undergoing a long-term overhaul.
The new limit on delivery systems is less than half the ceiling of 1,600 specified in the original Start treaty.
Not as dramatic as they might appear. The rules for counting warheads contain a big loophole. While each warhead on a ballistic missile is counted as one warhead, a heavy bomber is counted as carrying ""one warhead"" even though it may carry (in the case of a US B-52) up to 20 of them.
According to the Arms Control Association, a pro-disarmament pressure group, the US could theoretically meet the new limits by cutting just 100 warheads, while Russia would only need to cut 190.
In addition, the agreed ceilings refer to deployed warheads, not to warheads in storage. A warhead could, in theory, be put into storage, and then redeployed when needed.
The cuts in launchers are also, in practice, not all that challenging. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists estimates that Russia currently has 566 - well under the permitted ceiling of 700. It estimates that the US has 798, necessitating a cut of about 12%.
Supporters of the deal say that while it does not make big cuts, it is a useful confidence-building measure, which could pave the way for further nuclear deals with Russia.
They say it also signals to the rest of the world that the US and Russia are not ignoring their commitment under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to progressively disarm.
The important difference, according to the Arms Control Association, is that each side will now be able to carry out on-site inspections to verify how many warheads a missile is carrying. Together with satellite imagery, this should give an accurate picture of the other country's nuclear strength. Some other forms of verification will cease.
Yes, it says that both sides can engage in ""limited"" missile defence. Russia has warned that it will withdraw from the treaty if a future US missile defence shield weakens its nuclear deterrent.
The US Senate ratified it on 22 December, after much delay, so now all it needs is Russia's final approval. Russia's parliament, the Duma, is expected to ratify it - and the process may begin on 24 December.
The US wants further cuts in strategic nuclear arms, but is also keen to negotiate a reduction in Russia's short-range nuclear missile arsenal.
Russia wants the US to remove its 200 nuclear bombs from Europe (based in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey) and would like to restrict the US's ability to put conventional warheads on long-range missiles.","The New Start treaty, signed by the US and Russian presidents, replaces the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start), first proposed by US President Ronald Reagan in 1982 and signed in 1991, as the USSR sped towards collapse."

She was taken to St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey, and died after an overdose of the anti-seizure drug phenytoin.
Surrey Police asked the Woking coroner to halt the inquest to allow officers to re-examine the case after fresh expert evidence emerged at the hearing.
During the last two months of her life, Sophie suffered a series of seizures triggered by a reaction to infections.
The inquest heard this week that Dr Lojein Hatahet and paediatric consultant Dr Fiona MacCarthy had attempted to administer the anti-seizure drug using an automated syringe-driver.
It failed to work and it was decided Dr Hatahet would administer the drug from a handheld syringe, despite the protests of nurse Polly Leavold, who said the drug was not needed and that giving it by hand was against the hospital's protocol.

Representatives from the Health and Social Care Board said they had found it increasingly difficult to replace retiring GPs in rural practices, as doctors no longer want to work on their own.
They said this contrasted to the situation 20 years ago when there were about 40 applicants for a GP post in the nearby village of Newtownbutler.
Maple Health Care has taken over the patients of three single-handed practices in Roslea, Newtownbutler and Lisnaskea.
Dr Sloan Harper, director of integrated care at the Health and Social Care Board, said the temporary model of a GP from Lisnaskea providing services in Roslea for part of the week was not sustainable in the long term.
""It will mean some inconvenience, unfortunately, for a small number of patients living in the Roslea area and the board is disappointed that we haven't been able to continue that service,"" said Dr Harper.
""The doctors working here are taking on a major change process, going from a practice of 8,500 to 14,500 patients, taking over three practices.
""So it felt safer and more sustainable for them to work out of two sites, and so Newtownbutler - being the larger premises and having better car park arrangement - was felt to be doable.
""To spread their medical and nursing workforce, its not just about a doctor going down there... it was felt that was too big a stretch and so we feel the current arrangement is the best option available.""
Dr John Porteous from Maple Health Care in Lisnaskea, who has been a GP in Fermanagh for 29 years ,said there were so many GP vacancies that ""the least attractive practices just have no hope whatsoever"".
He added that for newly-qualified doctors, working alone in a small surgery in an isolated community would not be viewed as a ""comfortable experience"".
They would prefer to work somewhere ""where they can share the responsibility, where there would be safety if something were to go wrong"", he added.
""They've come through training practices where there would be quite a number of doctor and nurse colleagues, there would be lots of extra help on site.
""I'm a Fermanagh man all my life and my own dad was a single-handed GP for many years and, of its time, it was a good model but practice has become so complicated and the pressures are so high that I think you're going to find increasingly doctors are going to come together and form larger groups.
""Almost inevitably that will mean small villages will no longer have the local surgery and you will have fewer, larger health centre hubs.""","The long-term future of single-handed rural practices is ""unsustainable"", a public meeting to protest against the closure of a County Fermanagh GP surgery has been told."

35470675,"The Markit construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 55 from 57.8 - well below the 57.5 forecast by economists.
The figure contrasted with a stronger-than-expected start for the manufacturing sector published on Monday.
Factory output rose from 52.1 in December to 52.9 in January.
Any figure above 50 indicates growth in the sector.
Markit economist Tim Moore said construction firms were struggling for momentum, with increased economic uncertainty holding back new orders and contributing to one of the weakest rises in output levels since summer 2013.
""Taken together with the slowdown in new order growth, the latest survey suggests that construction companies are braced for a relatively subdued first quarter,"" he said.
David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which compiles the survey along with Markit, said a shortage of bricks and blocks contributed to the slowdown.
Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said weakness in construction orders and a downturn in public sector infrastructure work, which accounts for about a quarter of total construction and is not covered by the PMI, suggested the sector would post only ""lacklustre growth"" this year.
Optimism among construction companies waned to its lowest level since December 2014, the survey showed.
""Some firms highlighted concerns that underlying demand conditions had started to soften,"" Markit said.
Analysts use the PMI surveys for early signals about the economy. However, the construction sector figures have been at odds with data used in official growth figures in recent months.

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said that the policy is undermined by ""flawed and inaccurate data"".
Education Minister John O'Dowd said he would consider what additional action, if any, needed to be taken.
He said: ""The sustainable schools policy has been tested in court on several occasions and found to be a competent policy upon which to make decisions both about the future of individual schools and area planning more widely.

The PAC said it was ""unacceptable"" that the department could not provide accurate numbers of surplus places.
The committee is calling for up-to-date school enrolment figures to be gathered ""as a matter of urgency"".
The PAC report also said the department took too long to take decisions on whether to close schools, and whether suspended teachers should be dismissed.
It found that 106 teachers had been suspended during the past five years, but only six had been dismissed.

""In an age of austerity, people are not going out quite as much but when they do they're seeking out something different; they're a little bit more picky about where they go and are prepared to pay a little bit more.""
He said Welsh brewers are taking their beers across the UK and looking abroad. At home, 20 small Welsh breweries now have their own pubs.
Four micro breweries -  Bragdy Nant, Bragdy Conwy, Purple Moose and Great Orme - got together to reopen one pub in Conwy three years ago and recently bought two more.
Bragdy Conwy employs nine people and has enjoyed 20% year-on-year growth, supplying supermarkets, bars, restaurants and pubs.
Owner and head brewer Gwynne Thomas said it was difficult to predict the industry's future.
""About 2008, during the financial crisis, I thought we'd reached saturation point but the last few years growth has accelerated.
""It's a relatively straightforward but there are people who are good at the technical side of brewing but haven't got the organisational side right. You have to be strong at both.""
Q&A: Real ale? Craft beer? Confused?
The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) included 14 new Welsh breweries in its annual beer guide last year.
This is set against a background of a pub closures, which is running at a net loss of about 10 a month in Wales.
Spokesman Neil Walker said the boom in people setting up their own micro breweries or finding work in the industry ""can only be good news for the future of beer and pubs"" .","If the number of independent brewers in Wales continues to rise, it could hit the 100 mark within the next year."

Ian Stewart, Kieron Whittle, John Stewart, Alan Lea, Shaun McDonald and Gary McNeill were sentenced to between 12 and 16 years in prison.
All pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to conspiracy to commit robbery.
Police said the gang wore masks and either used ""brute force"" to force their way into premises or removed roof tiles to allow them to drop down through the ceiling.
Most of the raids - which happened in Sefton, St Helens, Wirral, Liverpool, Warrington, Neston, Birkenhead, Bootle, Southport, Hull and Sutton - occurred when staff were either opening or cashing up.
The gang members were given the following sentences:
Det Insp Mike Dalton of Merseyside Police said: ""This gang enjoyed a criminal lifestyle on the back of the misery of many decent, hard-working people who were simply doing their job when these men burst in and changed their lives forever.
""This gang was completely ruthless in what they did.
""They did not care who they harmed or what damage they caused as long as they got the money.""
He said: ""Innocent members of staff who were petrified at the time have remained too traumatised to return to work.
""A young mum was robbed of the enjoyment that having a young baby brings.
""Another who had a baby long after the robbery feared the stress she still felt could harm her unborn child.""","A gang of armed robbers who stole up to £1.5m in a series of bank and post office raids in Merseyside, Cheshire and east Yorkshire have been jailed."

28090419,"Their study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, argued elderly people had the least to gain.
The team at University College London (UCL) has called on doctors to discuss the risks more clearly with patients.
The charity Diabetes UK said doctors needed to strike a careful balance when prescribing treatment.
Type-2 diabetes is an inability to control blood sugar levels and is linked to lifestyle factors including diet and obesity.
In the long-term it is linked to heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage and even blindness.
Drugs such as metformin can be used to lower blood sugar levels to prevent the side effects.
The report, which was carried out by the University of Michigan as well as UCL, said an average 45-year-old who dropped their blood sugar levels by one percentage point would gain 10 months of healthy life, compared with three weeks for a 75-year-old starting treatment.
It added this needed to be balanced against the down-sides to a lifetime of medication including: Having to have multiple injections and blood sugar tests each day, drugs causing indigestion or sickness, or insulin treatments risking blood sugar levels dropping dangerously low (hypoglycaemia).
One of the report's authors, Prof John Yudkin, told the BBC: ""What it means is if you're someone with type-2, it's your right to know what the benefits of the treatment are in terms of gain in life expectancy or reduction in heart attacks or going blind.
""And then you are entitled to decide, but not many doctors have got those figures to hand.""
He said GPs were too ""target focussed"" and were often looking only at the blood sugar level.
The findings do not apply to people with type-1 diabetes.
Commenting on the report, Simon O'Neill, the director for health intelligence at Diabetes UK, said: ""Sometimes there is a balance to be struck where certain medications might help give someone a longer life, but also cause side effects that might negatively impact on quality of life.
""This study highlights the importance of looking at the individual needs of the person with type-2 diabetes, rather than adopting a blanket approach.""
Patients are advised not to make any decisions without consulting their GP.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which advises the NHS on medication, said: ""The current NICE guidance on the management of type-2 diabetes recognises that glycaemic [sugar] control targets should not impair a person's quality of life as a result of the side effects of treatment.
""Where medication does not help achieve this target level, lifestyle therapies such as dietary advice should be offered.""
Refreshed guidelines are due to be published next summer.","The downsides of taking medication for type-2 diabetes may exceed the benefits for some patients, researchers have advised."
28397474,"Abdul Hakim Belhaj claims the UK government helped to arrange for him to be forcibly transported from China to Libya in 2004, just as he was about to fly to London to claim asylum.
Mr Belhaj says he was then tortured as he had opposed the Gaddafi regime.
Last December, the High Court found the claims were beyond its jurisdiction.
At last year's hearing, the judge, Mr Justice Simon, said Abdul-Hakim Belhaj had a ""well-founded claim"" but pursuing it would jeopardise national security.
Lawyers for Mr Belhaj have now taken the case to the Court of Appeal, where Richard Hermer QC said Mr Belhaj and his wife believed ""the UK played a key role in their mistreatment and wish to pursue a remedy against the UK and its officials for that"".
Mr Belhaj, one of the leaders of the uprising against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, says he was abducted - along with his pregnant wife, Fatima Boudchar - in China in 2004 as he was about to fly to London to claim asylum.
He alleged the UK had tipped off Libyan intelligence services and helped the US arrange his rendition.
After he was returned to Libya, Mr Belhaj spent six years in jail, while his wife was released shortly before giving birth.
The couple had been attempting to bring a case against former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and former senior MI6 official Sir Mark Allen.
The High Court ruled that because most of the claims related to officials in China, Malaysia, Thailand and Libya the allegations were ""non-justiciable"" in the UK.
Analysis
By Dominic Casciani
This case matters for one simple reason: it involves allegations that the UK colluded in handing over a man to a regime that tortured him. And a decade on from these events we are still no closer to finding out exactly what happened.
The government has settled similar claims from former Guantanamo Bay inmates at a cost of millions of pounds - but a planned judge-led inquiry into these issues was scrapped.
That judge, Sir Peter Gibson, said there needs to be further investigation into complicity in rendition and torture - and the task was handed to Parliamentarians on the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC).
Critics believe the ISC isn't equipped to get the answers - an accusation the committee would deny - but that's another reason why the Belhaj case is so important.
However, addressing the Court of Appeal, Mr Hermer, representing Mr Belhaj, said the court was ""constitutionally competent"" to deal with the case.
""This court is the only forum in which remedies could possibly be obtained for those acts and omissions of the UK executive and its officials.
""If it can't be heard before this court, it will not be heard anywhere else as the principle of state immunity means it is highly unlikely that proceedings could be brought against UK officials in any other jurisdiction,"" he said
Mr Hermer said the case had ""profound and far-reaching"" implications for the rule of law in a world in which counter-terrorism was being fought by international co-operation. The effect of the High Court decision was that the state was to be placed above the law, he said.
The contested hearing is expected to last three days.

There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries.
A 4.4-magnitude quake was felt near Los Angeles earlier this month, rattling nerves but causing no major damage.
The latest earthquake was shallow at only 1.2 miles (2km) deep, according to the USGS.
It was felt across four counties, from Palm Springs in the east and Ventura County to the north, Reuters news agency reported.
The Los Angeles Fire Department said it was checking buildings and transport infrastructure for damage.
It said the quake was a reminder for people to be prepared.

34812397,"The Kurdish Peshmerga had held 20% of the town since December 2014, and although there had been daily fighting since then, the two sides had been at a stalemate.
Since Thursday, though, the Kurdish forces - backed by US air strikes - have made important ground, cutting early on the Highway 47 which passes Sinjar, the main supply line between IS' self-styled capital of Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in northern Iraq.
Capturing Sinjar will not only secure the highway, but the road south of Sinjar, towards the IS-held town of Baaj, is also reported to be under control of the Peshmerga forces.
This is supposed to provide a buffer zone large enough to keep Sinjar safe in the near future.
However, it is by no means preventing IS from using scores of small countryside roads south of Sinjar that are still available until the winter weather makes them unusable.
The next step has to be against the IS-held town of Tal Afar, and then Mosul.
If not, Sinjar will always face attacks from those points. Yet, if Sinjar is de facto Kurdish territory, Tal Afar and Mosul are not.
Profile: Who are the Peshmerga?
Who are the Yazidis?
Tal Afar is populated with Arabs and Turkmen: this means that the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) will not have any strategic interest in liberating and holding an area to which it has no claim.
The same goes for Mosul and Baaj. While KRG President Massoud Barzani has repeatedly hinted that his government would contribute to the retaking of Mosul, recapturing an Arab city could be perceived as an act of Kurdish aggression against Arabs, raising tensions with the Baghdad government and potentially harming the Kurdish minority that has continued to live in Mosul since IS took it.
Tactically, the town of Baaj, situated on higher grounds than Sinjar, will remain a perfect spot to target Sinjar.
Since the Peshmerga do not possess long-range missiles, how will they be able to create a strong enough buffer zone for the 3,000 Yazidis trapped on the mountain for more than a year to be able to safely return and live in their homes?
Moreover, as the IS frontline has been dissolved in Sinjar, IS is likely to return to its next best tactic: sending armoured vehicles packed with explosives to Peshmerga positions.
Once again, the Peshmerga are underequipped to face this daily threat.
The impending attack on Sinjar was an open secret.
Two weeks ago, I witnessed long military convoys that were already on their way to retake the town, only to be derailed by a claim by Peshmerga rivals - Turkey's Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) rebels based in northern Iraq that it had already been recaptured from IS.
The claim did not just halt Peshmerga operations: it gave ample time for IS fighters to prepare and tactically retreat from Sinjar, just as they did in Tikrit last spring, only to take Ramadi a few weeks later.
The PKK is not the only local force that might get in the way of the Peshmerga as they seek to sustain their war effort.
Local Arab populations fear that retributions might take place against them from the Yazidi militias that have been randomly formed since the occupation of Sinjar Mountain in August 2014.
When the Mosul Dam and the Zummar areas were recaptured from IS in late 2014, Yazidi militias kidnapped Arab women, drove villagers away and looted properties. There have been reports of more revenge attacks this year.
While KRG security forces have been trying to maintain civil peace in the area, those events have eroded social cohesion, which could sow the seeds of future ethnic conflicts.

27654454,"The prisoner swap came after secret talks between the US government and the Taliban, brokered by Qatar.
Bergdahl was serving with an Alaska-based infantry regiment in Paktika province near the Pakistani border and went missing on 30 June 2009, five months after being deployed to Afghanistan.
The circumstances of his capture remain murky, with speculation he may have walked away from his base out of disillusionment with the US campaign.  In March 2015, he was charged with desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy.
The US believes he was across the frontier in Pakistan for most of his captivity, reportedly held by the Haqqani network, which operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and is allied to the Afghan Taliban.
Profile: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl
The circumstances of Sgt Bergdahl's capture in 2009 remain unclear, although a Pentagon investigation a year later concluded he left his post in Paktika Province without authorisation, according to a Pentagon official speaking to Associated Press news agency.
Several commentators and soldiers have branded him a deserter and called for him to be punished.
The New York Times said on his disappearance in 2009 had noted he had left military areas before, during a training programme in California and an Afghan outpost, but returned each time.
US officials told the newspaper the report did not conclude whether Sgt Bergdahl had intended to permanently desert the military.
The US military's top-ranking officer, Gen Martin Dempsey, has that the Army would not ignore misconduct but that the 28-year-old was innocent until proven guilty. ""When he is able to provide the facts, we'll learn what happened.""
The defence department opened up an investigation into his disappearance and capture, appointing a two-star general with combat experience in Afghanistan to lead the inquiry.
Taliban officials say the 28-year-old was handed over near Khost, close to the the Afghan-Pakistan border, on the evening of 31 May. A several-dozen strong US special forces team flew in by helicopter and briefly met some 18 Taliban on the ground.
The exchange, captured on video, shows Sgt Bergdahl sitting in a pick-up truck before being walked to the helicopter.
Once the helicopter was in the air, Bergdahl wrote the letters ""SF?"" on a paper plate - an abbreviation for special forces - and reportedly broke down when the men responded: ""Yes, we've been looking for you for a long time.""
Taliban release video of handover
Sgt Bergdahl was the only US soldier being held by the enemy in the Afghan conflict, and Washington had long been seeking his release, spurred on by the ""Standing with Bowe"" campaign led by his parents in Hailey, Idaho.
Negotiations for the US-Taliban prisoner swap began three years ago with US and Taliban officials meeting face-to-face in Qatar.
But the talks did not move forward because the US were pushing for a wider peace process, while the Taliban wanted to limit the talks to a prisoner swap, Taliban sources told the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul.
Direct negotiations broke down a year ago when the Afghan government opposed the opening of a Taliban office in Qatar, although secret talks continued, mediated by Qatar.
The issue was given more impetus as plans solidified to pull nearly all American forces out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016. US sources say the breakthrough came when hardline Taliban leaders dropped their opposition to a swap.
On Thursday, Mr Obama said Sgt Bergdahl's health was deteriorating and officials were ""deeply concerned about it"".
But the prisoner swap was apparently sped up after US officials determined the Taliban would likely kill Sgt Bergdahl if any word of the deal was leaked, according to congressional and White House sources who spoke to the Associated Press.
Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel told the BBC's Katty Kay he and other military chiefs based their decision ""on the information that we had, that his life, his health, were in peril"".
His father Robert Bergdahl said Bowe was struggling to speak English after his long captivity. In an emotional White House lawn press conference with Barack Obama shortly after the release, Robert Bergdahl delivered his son a message in Pashto, the language of his captors.
After immediate medical attention at a military hospital in Germany,  Sgt Bergdahl was flown to San Antonio, Texas, to continue treatment.
On Friday, Army officials said he was in a ""stable condition"".
He ""looked good"", was in uniform, and saluted, Maj Gen Joseph DiSalvo said.
""He appeared just like any sergeant would when they see a two-star general - a little bit nervous,"" Gen DiSalvo said. ""But he looked good, saluted, and had good deportment.""
Can you lose your language?
The exchanged prisoners are Mohammad Fazl, Khirullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Mullah Norullah Noori and Mohammad Nabi Omari.
They are thought to be the most senior Afghans still held at Guantanamo, having been captured during America's military campaign in 2001.
Fazl served as the Taliban's deputy defence minister and is accused of possible war crimes, including the murder of thousands of Shia Muslims.
Khairkhwa served as interior minister and governor of Herat, Afghanistan's third largest city. He is alleged to have had direct links to Osama bin Laden.
US President Barack Obama says Qatar has given assurances ""that it will put in place measures to protect our national security"".
Under the deal, the five freed Taliban detainees will be banned from leaving Qatar for at least a year, meaning they cannot return to Afghanistan until after a majority of US forces have left.
The Associated Press' Kathy Gannon, who was shot in Afghanistan while covering the recent elections, says the five men are important but not likely to change the balance of the war - and having been away from Afghanistan for more than a decade, they would not find Taliban foot soldiers very loyal.
Some argue there is US precedent for this type of transfer, with Ronald Reagan's administration in 1985-86 reportedly winning the freedom of US hostages in Beirut in exchange for arms destined for Iran.
But Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, called it a fundamental shift in policy that would act as an incentive for further abductions of US personnel.
Some US lawmakers have complained the swap breaches a law that Congress should be given 30 days' notification before Guantanamo Bay detainees are released. The White House says it took the chance to free Sgt Bergdahl in ""unique and exigent circumstances"".
Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, normally a White House ally, was enraged that the president had not notified her or the intelligence committee she leads, of the pending swap, although a White House official did call her on Monday to apologise for the delay.
The US has a long-standing policy not to negotiate with those it deems terrorists and the prisoner swap has drawn criticism - especially from conservatives.
Republican Senator John McCain told the BBC the swaps ""threatened"" US security, as the detainees released were too dangerous to be walking free, and would put other US military lives at risk. Other lawmakers have called for a inquiry into the administration and military's decision making process.
But Mr Obama is publically unapologetic for the swap.
""We saw an opportunity and we seized it,"" he said, adding ""as commander-in-chief I am responsible for those kids"".
No Obama apology for Bergdahl deal
Correspondents say it is unclear what impact the release will have on a wider peace process.
The Afghan High Peace Council want talks with the Taliban to happen inside Afghanistan, and does not want to involve the Americans.
Bowe Bergdahl returned to the US on 13 June 2014, arriving at a medical centre in Texas where he finished the last phase of his reintegration process.
In his hometown of Hailey, Idaho, a rally scheduled months ahead was quickly turned into a homecoming event that was cancelled.
City officials cited safety concerns, because of a large increase in the number of expected attendees, and local officials have received messages blasting the town for honouring Sgt Bergdahl's return.
Sgt Bergdahl returned to active duty in July, working at a desk job at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston.
In March 2015, he was charged with desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty and misbehaviour before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command unit or place.
A preliminary hearing will be heard in front of a judge at Fort Sam Houston. A date has not been set for that hearing.
He faces up to five years in prison on the desertion charge and life in prison on the misbehaviour charge.

40654915,"It is an astonishing mass of material that has essentially been created only in the last 65 years or so.
The 8.3 billion tonnes is as heavy as 25,000 Empire State Buildings in New York, or a billion elephants.
The great issue is that plastic items, like packaging, tend to be used for very short periods before being discarded.
More than 70% of the total production is now in waste streams, sent largely to landfill - although too much of it just litters the wider environment, including the oceans.
""We are rapidly heading towards 'Planet Plastic', and if we don't want to live on that kind of world then we may have to rethink how we use some materials, in particular plastic,"" Dr Roland Geyer told BBC News.
A paper authored by the industrial ecologist from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and colleagues appears in the journal Science Advances. It is described as the first truly global assessment of how much plastic has been manufactured, how the material in all its forms is used, and where it ends up. Here are some of its key numbers.
There is no question that plastics are a wonder material. Their adaptability and durability have seen their production and use accelerate past most other manmade materials apart from steel, cement and brick.
From the start of mass-manufacturing in the 1950s, the polymers are now all around us - incorporated into everything from food wrapping and clothing, to aeroplane parts and flame retardants. But it is precisely plastics' amazing qualities that now present a burgeoning problem.
None of the commonly used plastics are biodegradable. The only way to permanently dispose of their waste is to destructively heat it - through a decomposition process known as pyrolysis or through simple incineration; although the latter is complicated by health and emissions concerns.
In the meantime, the waste mounts up. There is enough plastic debris out there right now, Geyer and colleagues say, to cover an entire country the size of Argentina. The team's hope is that their new analysis will give added impetus to the conversation about how best to deal with the plastics issue.
""Our mantra is you can't manage what you don't measure,"" Dr Geyer said. ""So, our idea was to put the numbers out there without us telling the world what the world should be doing, but really just to start a real, concerted discussion.""
Recycling rates are increasing and novel chemistry has some biodegradable alternatives, but manufacturing new plastic is so cheap the virgin product is hard to dislodge.
The same team - which includes Jenna Jambeck from the University of Georgia and Kara Lavender Law from the Sea Education Association at Woods Hole - produced the seminal report in 2015 that quantified the total amount of plastic waste escaping to the oceans each year: eight million tonnes.
This particular waste flow is probably the one that has generated most concern of late because of the clear evidence now that some of this discarded material is getting into the food chain as fish and other marine creatures ingest small polymer fragments.
Dr Erik van Sebille from Utrecht University in the Netherlands is an oceanographer who tracks plastics in our seas. Of the new report, he said: ""We're facing a tsunami of plastic waste, and we need to deal with that.
""The global waste industry needs to get its act together and make sure that the ever-increasing amounts of plastic waste generated don't end up in the environment.
""We need a radical shift in how we deal with plastic waste. On current trends, it will take until 2060 before more plastic gets recycled than landfilled and lost to the environment. That clearly is too slow; we can't wait that long,"" he told BBC News.
And Richard Thompson, professor of marine biology at Plymouth University, UK, commented: ""If plastic products are designed with recyclability in mind they can be recycled many times over. Some would say a bottle could be recycled 20 times. That's a substantial reduction in waste. At the moment poor design limits us.""
To illustrate that point, Dr Geyer said: ""The holy grail of recycling is to keep material in use and in the loop for ever if you can. But it turns out in our study that actually 90% of that material that did get recycled - which I think we calculated was 600 million tonnes - only got recycled once.""

He has granted the Aylesbury-based English Bridge Union permission for a full judicial review of its status.
Sport England has refused to recognise the game and said it was no more a sporting activity than ""sitting at home, reading a book"".
Mr Justice Mostyn, who said he played Bridge on social occasions, heard a claim the game ought to be recognised as a ""mind sport"" that exercises the ""brain muscle"".
Kate Gallofent QC, for Sport England, said the definition of a qualifying sport was an ""activity aimed at improving physical fitness and well being, forming social relations and gaining results in competition"".
That definition is based on a European Sports Charter promoting ""a common European definition of sport"".
However, the judge was told other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Ireland and Poland, ""recognise Bridge as a sport"".
Miss Gallofent insisted: ""The starting point of the definition of sport is physical activity. Bridge cannot ever satisfy this definition.""
Mr Justice Mostyn told her: ""If the brain is a muscle, it does.
""You are doing more physical activity playing Bridge, with all that dealing and playing, than in rifle shooting.

37768930,"However, with today's decision to recommend a third runway at Heathrow, this government has arrived at a point that its predecessors failed to.
From beating ourselves up for not building anything, we are suddenly building everything. Heathrow was chosen because of the extra boost it gives to the UK economy, but it is not the only mammoth project out there.
After a last minute wobble, the Â£18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power station has been given the green light, while the biggest of them all is coming down the track fast.
Construction on the Â£42bn HS2 high-speed rail line from London to the North is scheduled to begin next year. And that is probably not all.
The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has hinted he may reveal some moderate government borrowing to fund targeted infrastructure spending in his Autumn Statement next month. It is enough to make the Victorians sit up and take notice.
If projections for a fairly sharp post-Brexit slowdown in the economy next year are correct, we may need this spending boost.
Yet if these projects proceed on time, there is something else we will need: people to build it all. With unemployment close to historic lows, it is not clear we have enough.
As the Victorians did, it seems very likely we will need to look abroad to find the workers for what some say promises to be a golden age of infrastructure. And that, post-Brexit, will present a political rather than an engineering challenge.",We have a long way to go before the we see the proverbial shovels in the ground - there will be legal and planning challenges aplenty to come.
37779423,"The poll has been triggered by the resignation of Tory MP Zac Goldsmith in protest at the government's backing for a third runway at Heathrow.
Mr Goldsmith, who will run again as an independent, has said it ""must be a referendum on Heathrow expansion"".
But the likely Lib Dem candidate said Mr Goldsmith's backing for Brexit would be ""uppermost in voters' minds"".
Sarah Olney, who has already been selected to fight the seat at the next General Election, said it was a ""farce"" the by-election was taking place, saying it was the result of Tory in-fighting but added that the Lib Dems were looking forward to ""putting our message in front of voters"".
Ms Olney, who like Mr Goldsmith is opposed to Heathrow expansion, told the BBC's Daily Politics: ""We are on the same side as far as Heathrow is concerned, so for the voters to be able to choose between us, it's going to be fought on other issues - and I think Brexit is currently going to be the main issue that's uppermost in voters' minds.""
A local breakdown of the EU referendum results shows almost 70% of voters in the Richmond council area, which makes up the bulk of the constituency, backed Remain.
Ms Olney is expected to be confirmed as the party's pick for the by-election after party leader Tim Farron rejected the idea of parachuting in one of its big names.
The Conservatives are not fielding a candidate against Mr Goldsmith, who held the south-west London seat in 2015 with a 23,015 majority. The Lib Dems, who held the seat until 2010, finished second.
Labour says it will field a candidate despite three of its MPs urging it to consider standing aside to maximise the chances of a Tory defeat.
The Green Party said it was also likely to put forward a candidate although it said it supported ""progressives working together to beat the Conservatives"".
In standing down, Mr Goldsmith - who has long campaigned against a third runway -  fulfilled a pledge to quit if the government backed the expansion.
He said: ""There was no small print, no expiry date, no ambiguity. It was a simple promise. And it mattered.
""I know it mattered, because the thought of Heathrow expansion fills most of my constituents with dread.""","The Liberal Democrats have vowed to make the Richmond Park by-election about Brexit, not Heathrow."

Profits fell even faster. Pre-tax profits on continuing operations were down by 39% to £96m.
However, that does not include exceptional items. Post-tax reported profit was down 68% to £44m.
The company has had one-off costs of cutting back sharply on its overhead costs, shedding a 10th of its workforce in the first half of this year.
Wood Group is currently in a pay dispute with maintenance workers on Shell platforms in the UK North Sea.

""Our focus remains on managing costs, improving efficiency and maintaining capability. We are working with our customers to work smarter, streamlining work processes while increasing quality and efficiency.""
The engineering firm has told investors it expects full year profits to be 20% lower than in 2015.
The outlook was helped, it said, by early signs of oil production projects being given approval, and signs that the sharp drop in North American onshore drilling may have bottomed out.

The company said the new North Sea fields in which it has a significant interest, Kraken and Catcher, remain on schedule to be in production by the end of next year. The downturn in the oil market means the capital expenditure behind them has fallen between 10% and 20%.

34729150,"This is on a par with US President Barack Obama meeting with Cuba's Raul Castro except, unlike Washington and Havana, the two sides still haven't normalised relations. In fact they haven't even signed a peace treaty and in 66 years they have taken very different paths.
No agreements will be signed, no joint statements made, but China's Xi Jinping and Taiwan's Ma Ying-jeou will have an hour-long meeting and a casual dinner afterwards. It could get awkward and here are some of the questions that could crop up.
China has hundreds of missiles targeted at Taiwan to warn the island against declaring formal independence. Beijing still considers Taiwan a province to be reunified with the mainland one day and has not renounced the use of force to take it back. In fact, one of the main reasons for its military build-up is to counter possible US assistance to Taiwan if Beijing were to try to take back militarily.
Mr. Ma would argue: ""If you want to be friends, you must remove these missiles.""
""Not that simple,"" Mr Xi might answer. Doing so could embolden pro-independence groups in Taiwan who want the island to be recognised as a completely separate country from China.
The meeting will take place less than three months before Taiwan holds presidential and legislative races, but truly democratic elections like these are not in China's vocabulary. Taiwan, on the other hand, has developed into a vibrant democracy and is proud of its system.
Over dinner, Mr Ma could share his low approval rating headaches with Mr Xi and even make jokes about how hard it is to finish a speech when protesters are trying to throw shoes at him. Mr Xi might just politely smile and think to himself: ""And you wonder why we run things like we do?""
Mr Xi will be eager to push relations forward. During Mr Ma's seven years in office, the two sides have signed many agreements - from those that have allowed first-ever direct flights to ones that bring millions of Chinese tourists to Taiwan each year, not to mention tariff-cutting trade deals.
China is eager to link Taiwan's economy and society even closer to the mainland's, and begin talking about unification.
But Mr Ma will have to explain that public opinion does not support more deals and such talks at the moment. Many people are worried too many deals signed too quickly and without enough public oversight may make the island over-dependent on China and vulnerable to unification pressures.
Mr Ma might explain to Mr Xi: ""In Taiwan, unlike mainland China, public opinion matters a lot. That is how I got my job in the first place.""
Like many Chinese people who consider Taiwan the long-lost sibling they must see at least once in their lifetime, Mr Xi would want to eventually travel to ""our treasured island"" which is what many Chinese people call Taiwan.
But Mr Ma will not be able to extend the invitation. That would be asking for trouble. Given China's motive for developing stronger ties, Taiwanese not in favour of this would simply use it as a chance to protest, and perhaps throw shoes at Mr Xi.
Mr Ma says the past seven years have brought about the most stable and peaceful period in cross-strait relations in 66 years. One of his hopes before his presidency ends next May is to use these talks to institutionalise meetings between leaders of the two sides so that relations will stay on the right track, and the two sides can have dialogue at the highest level, regardless of which political party comes into power in Taiwan.
But Mr Xi would probably say: ""That all depends on whether the next leader agrees to our condition."" And the condition is to accept that Taiwan and mainland China are part of one China. So far, the candidate tipped to win, Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence opposition party, has refused to do that.
It's almost sacrilegious in the shared Chinese culture of Taiwan and China to split the bill in a formal banquet, but at the Singapore dinner, the two sides will have to deal with the awkward moment when the bill comes.
They've decided to split it because not doing so would give the impression that one is a host and the other a guest, and that they are not meeting on an equal level. And that would cause trouble for Mr Ma, because he's facing domestic pressure not to give any suggestion that Taiwan is a lesser, weaker party in the talks.
But while some think Mr Ma shouldn't meet Mr Xi, others believe two former enemies agreeing to talk can only be a good thing. They hope the talks can raise mutual understanding and trust - and perhaps that will happen over a few glasses of Singapore Sling.","On Saturday, for the first time since their bitter split at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, the leaders of China and Taiwan will meet."

Investigators are examining the cause of the crash, which happened as the bus was bound for Los Angeles.
Rescuers used ladders to climb into the bus windows to remove bodies. Five of the injured passengers are in critical condition.
The Los Angeles Times described the crash as the deadliest in California for several decades. It said that the bus careered into the rear of the truck at high speed, mangling the front third of the bus.
Most of those who died were apparently at the front of the bus, the newspaper reported. The driver was among the fatalities.
Officials quoted by the paper said that identifying the victims could take days, because some were not carrying identity cards or had lost their belongings when they were taken to hospital.
They have warned that it may not be possible to determine exactly why the accident happened because of the driver's death.
Investigators will assess whether he might have fallen asleep or had a heart attack, in addition to determining if there was a mechanical failure or some other kind of emergency.

Details of his release are not known but a ransom was reportedly demanded.
He was the latest diplomat to be kidnapped in recent months in Venezuela, which suffers from high levels of violent crime.
Venezuelan Interior Minister Tarek El Aissami said via Twitter that Mr Cholele was in good shape and being taken by police to be reunited with his family.
His release had been secured due to investigative work and police pressure, Mr El Aissami wrote.

36511598,"The claim: The UK leaving the European Union would mean cuts to pensions, defence and the NHS.
Reality Check verdict: What, if anything, gets cut if there is a Brexit will be a matter for the government to decide.
""If we restrict our access [to the single market] we will be less well off and that obviously affects what we can spend on our public services,"" he said.
In the past few days, voters have been warned that leaving the European Union would have severe effects on different areas of public spending.
We've been told both by David Cameron and Labour's Tom Watson that the triple-lock protection on state pensions would be threatened.
We've had Chancellor George Osborne warning that Brexit would lead to between £1bn and £1.5bn of cuts to defence spending.
He pointed out that even if the government stuck to Nato's target of spending 2% of national income on defence, if national income fell, then so would defence spending.
And the prime minister has also warned about spending on the NHS being threatened if the UK left the EU.
Why are they making these warnings? Because economic forecasters have said that leaving the European Union would mean the economy would grow by less than it would have done. That would mean lower tax revenues for the government, which would mean it would struggle to achieve a budget surplus as promised in 2019-20.
What the government chose to do about that would be a question of policy, as David Cameron confirmed, but that has not stopped various groups having a guess.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies predicted the government would decide to delay balancing the budget, bringing in an extra one or two years of austerity at the current rate.
Labour In for Britain said the government would attempt to balance the budget in 2019-20, meaning it would need to make savings of £28bn, which would be divided equally between tax rises, departmental spending cuts and cuts to social security spending.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the government would be trying to save an extra £44bn in 2019-20.
It is also possible that the government could decide not to balance the budget and borrow more instead.
There is a pretty strong consensus that the initial economic shock from a vote to leave the EU would make it harder to achieve a balance in 2019-20, although it could be smaller than some groups have predicted.

32047992,"Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it.
But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with ""extreme verve and vigour.""
But one critic of the register said it was ""fake"" and full of ""loopholes"".
Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions.
The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics.
However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working ""in-house"" for companies or organisations.
A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall.
But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given.
""We are having something that has never been in place before,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.""
Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different ""levels of lobbying"".
""The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,"" she said.
She added: ""This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain.
""If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.""
Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than ""20 expressions of interest"" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively.
Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an ""information return"".
But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said ""hardly anyone"" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law.
""You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,"" she told Today.
""The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for.
""It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction. It is a fake register.""","The woman in charge of the government's new register of lobbyists has said she expects the industry to ""conform"" with the statutory system."

Former Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live
I am surprised in that I think that is the one area of the pitch where they have enough options. Manchester City's attack has been sensational this season. Bernardo Silva is very similar to David Silva. I wouldn't let David Silva go, I think he's been tremendous.
You don't know if other clubs were ready to push the button and City thought 'we have got to do it'. There are some players that come along and you have to do it there and then.
Tottenham defender Danny Rose, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live
I played against him away this season and he's the best opponent I faced. It's a great addition and gives Pep Guardiola another attacking option.
BBC Sport's Simon Stone:
Silva was excellent in Monaco's 5-3 Champions League defeat at Etihad Stadium in February and Pep Guardiola decided the Portuguese was a man he wanted. So much so, in fact, that he is prepared to put him among the top five most expensive players in City history.
A product of the Benfica academy, Silva is an attacking right-sided midfield player and is, at 22, just the kind of age Guardiola likes - old enough to understand his role, young enough to absorb the intricate tactical lessons his new manager imparts.
If, as expected, Kyle Walker also arrives this summer from Tottenham, Guardiola will have the raw pace from his full-back that creates the danger - and space - for Silva to cut inside and slice open defences.

On Syria, President Obama and the EU leaders said attacks on the city of Aleppo by Syrian government troops and Russia ""should be immediately halted"".
Mrs May said the leaders ""were united in our condemnation of the atrocities that are taking place there"".
""We agreed the need to keep up the pressure on Russia, including the possibility of sanctions on those who breach international humanitarian law,"" she added.
Russia launched its air strikes in Syria in September 2015, saying it was acting at the request of President Bashar al-Assad. Moscow denies targeting civilians, saying it is bombing Islamic militants.
In a separate development in Berlin, Mrs May said preparations for the UK's exit from the EU were ""on track"".
""We do stand ready to trigger Article 50... by the end of March 2017.""

He said Britain would ""certainly have to fulfil its commitments"" to the EU until its departure - and possibly after.",Outgoing US President Barack Obama and EU leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to Nato unity and sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis.
23320624,"Peers backed a government bill paving the way for gay couples to marry. It is set to become law by the end of the week, with the first weddings in 2014.
Labour's Lord Alli said its passage meant ""my life and many others will be better today than it was yesterday"".
But Tory peer Lord Framlingham said the ""ill-thought through"" change had been ""bulldozed"" through Parliament.
Peers approved the principle of same-sex marriage last month, despite efforts by opponents to ""wreck"" the legislation.
MPs had earlier done the same, in the face of opposition from many Conservatives, the Church of England and other faith groups.
Supporters of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill wore pink carnations during Monday's proceedings in the Lords, during which a series of minor amendments - including one relating to pension benefits for same-sex couples - were proposed.
Government minister Lady Stowell said the bill ""puts right something which is wrong"" and had been improved by detailed scrutiny in the Upper House. ""I can't claim to be a gay rights campaigner, but I am a firm believer in justice and fairness,"" she said.
But the Gay Marriage No Thanks group claimed it had been prevented from mounting an advertising campaign around Parliament after its truck was vandalised and its driver threatened.
After clearing the Lords, the bill will return to the Commons for a short debate on government amendments before the Commons begins its summer recess on Thursday. The bill must then receive Royal Assent before it becomes law.",Same-sex marriage in England and Wales is a step closer to becoming law after the House of Lords approved the change.
32300669,"We were told by the pro-Russian rebels, who guided us, and other journalists, that things were quiet in the village of Shyrokyne, near the strategic port city of Mariupol.
But within minutes of arriving, there are loud explosions.
A man lies seriously wounded on the ground. He's bleeding badly from the head.
We learn he's called Andrei and is a journalist working for Russia's military TV channel.
A member of the BBC's team starts to treat him. He's joined by two medics from the OSCE.
Andrei has lost a lot of blood and his body is shaking violently as he goes into shock.
A local woman is screaming hysterically, as blood stains the pavement outside the local shop where he's now lying, and the journalists brought to monitor this peace mission crowd around.
The three men treating Andrei manage to stem the bleeding, but there are then exchanges of gunfire nearby.
What sound like rocket propelled grenades are also fired.
There is no ceasefire here, even when the OSCE are in the village.
The BBC-OSCE team gets Andrei into an old green Soviet-era van, and he is driven away to the local hospital.
Later we learn he is still alive, but in a serious condition.
His colleague tells us that Andrei said he needed the toilet. When he walked behind the shop, we believe he triggered a booby trap.
It was a short walk that might have cost him his life, and it was a reminder of how volatile the ceasefire agreement is here.
Later we meet two elderly women who are still living in this village on the frontline.

New signing Jerome Leduc scored twice and Mike Forney got the other as the Giants took control of the contest.
Mark Richardson gave Cardiff hope and Sean Bentivoglio got it back to 3-2 before Joey Haddard equalised and Patrick Asselin netted the winner.
It was a devastating final period for the Giants who had hoped to cut the Devils lead to a single point.
Now Derrick Walser's men must pick themselves up immediately as they host Cardiff again in Belfast on Saturday night.
As befitting a clash between the top two teams, the game started at a frenetic pace which lasted the entire first period.
Both keepers were kept busy but it was the Devils' Ben Bowns who was beaten first as debutant Giant Leduc, signed only this week, finished with aplomb in front of goal to give the home side the lead in the 14th minute.
With 48 seconds of the period remaining, a Forney shot sneaked past the unsighted Bowns to raise the roof at the SSE Arena as the Giants snatched a two-goal advantage.
Leduc's fine start in a Giants shirt continued in the second period when he slammed in his second goal of the night to make it 3-0 on a Belfast power play.
The visitors were not daunted by that deficit and came back hard at the Giants with a number of impressive saves from Stephen Murphy keeping the three-goal margin intact.
But there was an almighty twist in the tale. The Devils struck early in the final period as Richardson arrowed the puck into the top corner of the net past Murphy.
Now it was the small but vocal contingent of fans from Wales who were making all the noise in the arena as the scoreline became 3-2 as a Bentivoglio shot was deflected into the net off Giants' player-coach Walser, setting up a tense finale.
Haddard then made it 3-3 with less than six minutes remaining.
Then, incredibly, Patrick Asselin's close-range finish completed a remarkable turnaround by the Devils in what could well have been a huge step towards the Elite League title.",Leaders Cardiff Devils came from 3-0 down to beat their main rivals for the Elite League title in Belfast.
36191435,"Arlene Foster, Martin McGuinness, Mike Nesbitt, Colum Eastwood and David Ford all took part in Election 2016: The Leaders' Debate.
They were questioned by a studio audience made up mostly of grassroots supporters and some undecided voters.
The debate was simulcast to UK-wide audiences on the BBC News channel.
It was hosted by Noel Thompson.
An early flashpoint in the debate came between Mike Nesbitt and Arlene Foster over who should be first minister.
""I think that Arlene has a five-word plan - do not mention Peter Robinson,"" said Mr Nesbitt.
""I have a one-point plan - the Ulster Unionist one-point plan is make it work. Make Stormont work.""
Mrs Foster replied: ""Unlike Mike Nesbitt, I remember the bad old days of pushover unionism.
""I remember what it was like in 1998 when we had a concession a day to the IRA, I remember what happened in relation to prisoners, I remember what happened to the RUC.""
David Ford said that the argument over who should be first minister was about trying to frighten people.
""I think it's rather sad that this is now the third election in a row that the DUP's campaign has been based on the politics of fear.
He added: ""Not looking forward to the future, not looking about growing our economy, not looking about growing a united community, not looking to meet the needs of our children to stop them emigrating.
""Instead of that we're just into who's biggest and who's not biggest.""
Martin McGuinness and Colum Eastwood also clashed over who would be in government or opposition after the election.
Mr McGuinness accused the SDLP leader of not knowing ""what he wants to do"" over being in government, but Mr Eastwood responded that the election is ""not a coronation"".
""I am going into government. Colum can't say that tonight. I am going into government,"" said Mr McGuinness.
Mr Eastwood replied: ""Not like in the south, where they've refused to go into government at every opportunity.""
During the debate, the leaders also faced questions on health, the past, the economy and the make-up of the government after the election.
Following the debate, political discussion continued in The Spin Room, a programme that provided instant analysis and reaction to the leaders' debate.
The programme featured senior representatives from the Green Party, TUV and UKIP.
An invited audience of commentators, members of the public and private sector, and young people from the BBC Generation 2016 initiative also gave their views on the debate.",The leaders of Northern Ireland's five main parties have gone head-to-head in a debate before Thursday's assembly election.
33707529,"Offences for which lower compensation was awarded included ones involving drink, drugs or violence.
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority said statutory guidance obliged it to reduce or refuse awards if victims had unspent convictions.
A leading child abuse lawyer called for a review of the ""scandalous"" approach.
Alan Collins said civil case judges increasingly took the opposite view, and accepted that abuse could have a lifelong effect, with addictions being a possible consequence.
Since 2010, CICA - an executive agency sponsored by the Ministry of Justice - has awarded compensation to 12,665 people who were sexually abused as children, or as adults lacking mental capacity.
But some 438 people have had their government-funded compensation reduced because they had committed criminal offences themselves, the BBC learned after a series of Freedom of Information requests.
Of the 27 cases where compensation was reduced between June 2014 and June 2015, half were for drink, drugs, theft or property offences. Eight involved violence against people.
CICA would not say how many applications by such victims had been rejected.
""The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme has always asked that awards are reduced or refused if the victim had unspent convictions,"" it said in a statement.
The Ministry of Justice said the refusal or reduction of an awarded payment reflected the fact the individual ""may have caused distress, loss or injury to another person, and cost the taxpayer money through a police investigation or court proceedings"".
It said there were no plans to review the scheme.
Odette Tovey, a Sheffield-based legal representative for several grooming victims whose applications have been rejected by CICA, said: ""The crimes committed against the victims far outweigh the crimes that these victims committed.""
Some of these had been abused for many years, from their early teens, added Ms Tovey, and CICA was their only route to potential compensation.
Ms Tovey said CICA needed to take into consideration that victims' crimes ""were as a result of mental health problems developed because of the period of abuse they went through"".
Victims could be eligible for compensation of Â£27,000 if no deductions were made, said Ms Tovey.
The average award after CICA compensation reduction was Â£8,423.
Jane was groomed and abused for more than four years after running away from her South Yorkshire home at the age of 15.
She was given drugs and alcohol and forced to have sex with men she did not know.
A lead witness at her abuser's trial, Jane was turned down for compensation because she has unspent convictions for theft and assault - offences which took place before the trial took place and when she says she was addicted to so-called legal highs.
She has since given up drugs, has married, and is pregnant with her first child.
Jane - not her real name - has paid back the money she stole and says she feels remorse for her actions, but says they should not negate her compensation.
She told the BBC: ""I've hurt someone else, they didn't expect to be hurt, they didn't deserve to be hurt, I just hurt them so I could get money.
""I've been told by a couple of people that they received about Â£15,000, and that makes me really angry - because while the main witnesses haven't received anything, the others have.""","Compensation has been reduced for more than 400 sex abuse victims in Britain who later committed criminal offences, the BBC has learnt."

But Giles says the 31-year-old is worth at least £8m, underlining Cardiff's malaise in the Championship.
""They are going to get £3.5m and they're selling him on the cheap. And that tells me where the club is going: nowhere,"" said Giles.
Marshall agreed personal terms with Hull after being omitted from Saturday's Championship defeat by Reading.
The 31-year-old has made more than 280 appearances for Cardiff since arriving from Norwich City for free in 2009.
Cardiff are 17th in the 24-strong division with one win, two draws and two defeats.
Marshall is widely regarded as their star player and Giles, who had two playing stints with the club lasting a combined total of six years, is unhappy at the player leaving.
""I think it's a joke. Personally I think David Marshall is worth £8m, probably more than that to any club,"" said Giles before Marshall's move was finalised.
""Football today, I hate it, all these stats - they keep going on with stats, but if you look at Marshall's stats, they would without a doubt be better than anyone in the Championship and be a lot better than goalkeepers in the Premier League and they've let him go.

Chris initially thought he may have had an ulcer and was not concerned.
""My health was fine, I was a 40-something rugby player. I worked shifts and thought any tiredness was down to an unusual sleep pattern.""
But after receiving a pinprick test at his local blood clinic in Ballymoney, nurses told Chris that he could not donate blood because his iron levels were unusually low and advised him to visit his local GP who then referred him for a colonoscopy.
Chris was then diagnosed with GIST, a rare cancer that occurs in the wall of the stomach and small intestine.

But this 7ft tall New Zealander with a sleeve of tattoos is fast becoming the star of the NBA play-offs and is even putting the league's most valuable player Stephen Curry in the shade.
Adams and his Oklahoma City Thunder side beat Golden State Warriors 118-94 in game four of the Western Conference finals on Tuesday, to lead last year's champions 3-1 in the best-of-seven series.
It was the first back-to back defeats for the Warriors this season, a team who set a new NBA record of 73 wins in the regular season.
Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were the stars of the show for the Thunder, but even they were eclipsed by a moment of magic from Adams.
The 22-year-old, who scored 11 points and seven rebounds in the win, threw a one-handed bullet pass to Andre Roberson just before half-time.
More than 22,000 tweets were sent in an hour about Adams' baseball style throw and the player began trending on Twitter in his native New Zealand and the US.
Then there was a young fan who turned up to the game at Oklahoma's Chesapeake Arena, dressed as Adams with a fake moustache and tattoos in tribute to her hero.
Many Twitter users felt the youngster was the real star of game four and even Adams himself tweeted that it was ""absolutely amazing"".
In game three Adams hit the headlines after Warriors forward Draymond Green kicked him in the groin area, but avoided suspension.
It led to Thunder fans using the hashtag #standupforsteven in the build-up to Tuesday's game.
Adams has rarely been out of the headlines in the series. After game one he had to apologise for referring to the Warriors' players as ""quick little monkeys"".

37574709,"Pregabalin, also known by the brand name Lyrica, is an anti-epileptic drug also used to relieve chronic pain.
Last year, pregabalin was prescribed more in Northern Ireland than anywhere else in the UK.
The drug has been linked to the deaths of two teenagers earlier this year. It was one of a cocktail of drugs used by  Aaron Strong, 19, and Aaron Fox, 16.
'With Lyrica, I see people running about like zombies'
An ex-drug user, who lost his teenage friend to suicide after a battle with drugs, has told BBC News NI that abuse of Lyrica is ""wrecking lives"".
The Belfast teenager, who spoke anonymously, said he first took the drug when he was 16 and that it is freely available in his community.
Read more on his story here.
It is illegal to have class C drugs without a prescription and illegal to supply or sell them to others.
The Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs made the recommendation in a letter to ministers, including the then home secretary Theresa May, in January.
The letter cited warnings from the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) who highlighted ""significant misuse and abuse"" of the drug.
Pregabalin is known as ""bud"" or ""Budweisers"" by recreational users because it is makes them feel the same high as if they were drunk.
Life on Lyrica: Geoff Savage, drug counsellor
I am a prescribed user of Lyrica.
There's a stigma around drugs prescribed by professionals. That they're safe and not harmful. Prescribed drugs can sometimes be more serious if they're not taken properly.
Being someone who takes it, I know the dangers with it. I once overdosed by accident. I was out of my head.
Read more of Geoff's story here.
Joe Brogan, the HSCB's head of pharmacy, said the problem ""appears to be a growing issue"".
In 2012, Mr Brogan wrote to GPs and pharmacists telling them to be aware of the ""potential misuse of the drug"".
It is understood that some doctors have written to patients who have been prescribed Lyrica to say they may need to review the dosage.
""We've been raising it with general practitioners and prescribers in primary care to be mindful of repeat prescriptions of the drug,"" said Mr Brogan.
""It can be a challenge for prescribers to understand if the patient is getting sufficient treatment as it's often used for a chronic pain issue.""
Pregabalin can be ordered online. It is understood it has been coming into Northern Ireland in fairly constant levels for a number of years, along with other prescription drugs including diazepam and temazepam.
Packages of the drug ordered by customers in Northern Ireland are intercepted by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the UK Border Agency at airports in England every week.
Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI home affairs correspondent
The organised crime branch of the PSNI is notified about every seizure of the drug and decides what action, if any, is to be taken.
If the quantity of drugs intercepted is considered insignificant the police may decide not to take investigative action, but intelligence about the specified delivery address is recorded for possible future use.
The drugs are then destroyed.
If the quantity of drugs is large, or it is believed a seizure could be linked to an ongoing operation by the serious organised crime branch, or connected to an individual regarded as a significant criminal figure, the drugs are retained for possible use as evidence in a future court case.
If they are used in this way, they are destroyed when the court case is completed.
Stephen Andrews, a community worker in north Belfast, said the drug is a ""serious problem"".
""I first came across Lyrica about a year ago,"" he said. ""Myself and a colleague were called out by a residents to a young person who was banging his head off a brick wall repeatedly.
""He was covered in blood and wired out of his head. We took him to hospital and later found out he was on this drug.
""It's a strange drug. It might make you take your clothes off because you are too warm, it makes you feel like you have super strength. You feel no pain.""
Mr Andrews said he believes the drug badly affects the mental health of users and can lead to depression and suicide in users.
""Kids are always looking for the next high. Our fear is that people have been taking it for a period of time and we're not aware of it yet. These people will get in a very bad way.""
Alex Bunting. from Addiction NI, said the drug was finding its way onto the streets after being prescribed.

Meteors are small space rocks ranging from the size of a grain of sand to a pea that enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, producing a bright streak of light.
Most meteors break off from comets, which are dirty ""snowballs"" mainly made of ice, but the Geminids are different.
The object they come from, the 3200 Phaethon, is more like an asteroid.
As it orbits, the heat of the Sun causes surface material to crumble, before it tumbles off into space, leaving a trail of rocky debris behind it.

37770432,"The tech giant sold 45.51 million iPhones in the three months to 24 September, beating an average estimate of 44.8 million.
The company also forecast higher-than-expected holiday season revenue of between $76bn and $78bn.
But revenue in the fourth quarter fell 9% to $46.85bn.
That meant annual revenue fell for the first time since 2001, highlighting a slowdown in the smartphone market as well as intensifying competition, particularly from Chinese rivals.
Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC Technology correspondent
It was no surprise that Apple saw its first fall in annual revenues for 15 years. It became apparent earlier in the year that sales of the iPhone - surely the most profitable product in history - had plateaued and they continued to disappoint this quarter. It was hard to spot any product or market delivering outstanding results - the fact that Apple still hasn't released any figures for its Watch tells its own story - and the 30% fall in China sales looked particularly worrying.
But somehow Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook still managed to paint a rosy picture. He pointed to the 24% rise in income from services like Apple Music and Apple Pay. He told us that he was thrilled with the response of customers to the iPhone 7 - and that round the world, including in China, demand was outstripping supply.
And crucially he looked forward to a return to growth in the next quarter, with Apple forecasting a record-breaking holiday season. Investors have been looking for reasons to buy back into Apple and that prediction may help continue the recent upward path of the shares.
But the technology crowd is still waiting for some radical new innovation, to prove the company founded by Steve Jobs hasn't lost its creative spark. Tim Cook wouldn't be drawn when quizzed about moves into TV or building a car or a connected speaker like the Amazon Echo. He did say ""we have the strongest product pipeline we've ever had"". But that is a line we have been hearing for some time.
Apple executives said demand for the new iPhone 7 was strong, despite fiscal fourth-quarter revenue falls in China and the Americas, its two most important markets.
Revenue from Greater China, once seen as Apple's next growth hope, fell 30% in the quarter, after dropping 33% in the previous quarter.
In the same period last year, revenue from Greater China doubled.
Apple's shares were down 3% at about $114.80 in after-hours trading.
""Apple didn't have a great [fourth quarter] as iPhones, Macs, China, the US and what appears to be Watch were down,"" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.
Net income fell to $9.01bn in the fourth quarter, down from $11bn in the same quarter last year.
For the year, net income fell to $45.7bn from $53.4bn.
Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said it was ""impossible to know"" if there was any effect yet from rival Samsung halting production of Galaxy Note 7 phones earlier this month.","Apple has reported its third quarter in a row of falling iPhone sales and revenue, but sales beat analyst expectations."

Authorities say that selfies will be banned on the days that people ritually bathe in the sacred Godavari river.
Organisers say they conducted a study that showed people took too long taking selfies. This slows down the flow of people, leading to pushing and panic.
Signs saying ""no selfie zone"" can be seen around the two festival sites in the state of Maharashtra.

The decision was taken after over 100 volunteers conducted a study on behalf of the Kumbhathon group which works with the authorities to help monitor the festival.

Legal filings indicated that 250,000 people had lost some Â£130m in benefits.
The Court of Appeal suggested the Department for Work and Pensions would owe a mere 1% of that amount, Â£1.3m, to just 2,500 people.
The complex judgment on Friday was originally prompted by a challenge from Cait Reilly, a geology graduate from Birmingham.
She had argued that requiring her to work at Poundland for no pay constituted a breach of her human rights.
The government - to counter such claims - had retrospectively altered the law to validate the docking of benefits.
Today, the Court of Appeal ruled that even under that new revised law, the docking of benefits could be incompatible with the European Convention of Human Rights.
The Court's ruling represented a defeat for the government.
Padraig Hughes, of Public Interest Lawyers, the group that brought Ms Reilly's case, said: ""It is yet a further example of the reckless approach this Government continues to take towards the constitution and the rule of law.""
The Court of Appeal judges did nevertheless acknowledge that government ministers can change laws to affect cases retrospectively.
And the judges decided that the only rights infringed upon where those of people that had already claimed the benefits docking was unfair.
This narrowing of the claimants explains why only a tiny fraction of people will be eligible for a payout.
""We are considering the judgment"", a DWP spokesman said. ""It is only right that jobseekers do all they can to find work while claiming benefits.""
It is not clear yet whether either side will make a further appeal.",The government has lost the latest round of an extended legal battle involving the docking of benefits for jobseekers who refused to participate in unpaid back-to-work schemes.

34398381,"Activists in Brighton voted in favour of a motion tabled by the Unite union to make their support for strikes conditional on UN backing.
The vote is not binding on MPs but Jeremy Corbyn has said the party must heed the opinion of members.
It follows calls from a senior Labour figure for a free vote in Parliament.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told a meeting hosted by The Guardian at the Labour conference that Syria and the renewal of Trident were issues on which he did not expect consensus within the party and he believed a vote on military action in Syria should be made ""on the basis of conscience"".
The government was defeated in 2013 in a parliamentary vote on military action in Syria, but ministers have since said the case for UK intervention in the country should be made again.
In 2014 MPs voted in favour of RAF air strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq.
Labour's new leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for a UN security council resolution and a fresh diplomatic push to end the violence in Syria.
The Labour conference will also consider an emergency motion, tabled by the union Unite, opposing the extension of the RAF's campaign against IS into Syria without ""clear and unambiguous"" authorisation from the UN.
But Mr McDonnell told a meeting on the fringe of the conference that many MPs did not back the leader's stance and said it may be necessary for them to ""agree that we can't agree"" - though he said that efforts to reach a consensus within the party were still ongoing.
Mr McDonnell said: ""When you are sending people to potential loss of life, I think it is a conscience decision. It is a moral decision.
""On Syria, my view is it should be a free vote on the basis of conscience.""
Prime Minister David Cameron has indicated he would like to extend the RAF airstrikes against the Islamic State group into Syria and could gain parliamentary backing from rebel Labour MPs, even if the party's leadership refuses to offer its support.
Mr Corbyn set out his views on Syria during his conference speech on Tuesday, saying that ""the answer to this complex and tragic conflict can't simply be found in a few more bombs"".
He added: ""I believe the UN can yet bring about a process that leads to an end to the violence in Syria.""
Meanwhile, the defeated Labour leadership contender Andy Burnham is to offer a tougher line on EU immigration during his speech on the final day of the conference.
Mr Burnham is to say that rules around the free movement of people in the EU are ""widening inequality"" and measures are needed to prevent the undercutting of wages by migrant workers.
In a speech aimed in part to win back voters from UKIP, the shadow home secretary will say the EU must provide a ""floor beneath all workers"" and protect the ""going rate"" on pay.
Mr Burnham, who was appointed shadow home secretary after he was heavily defeated by Mr Corbyn in the leadership race, will say that Labour had not ""faced up"" to some of the impacts of EU migration and consequently appeared ""out of touch"".
He will say: ""To win back the voters we lost to UKIP I want to reframe the debate about immigration and the way Labour approaches it.
""For too long we have argued that free movement across Europe benefits everyone and affects all areas equally. That's just not true.
""In places, a free market in labour benefits private companies more than people and communities.
""Labour hasn't faced up to that and that's why we look out of touch.""","Labour members have voted to oppose airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Syria, without a mandate from the United Nations."
15789553,"Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) said rock was dug away from cliffs near Bearreraig Bay in an apparent organised search for valuable specimens.
The agency said Skye was known as Scotland's ""Dinosaur Isle"" because of its important fossil records.
SNH has appealed for witnesses to contact the police.
Skye is a key dinosaur fossil site in Scotland.
Bearreraig Bay, north of Portree, is within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A crowbar is suspected to have been used to prise away some of the rock.
Dinosaur footprints may also have been removed from Valtos on Skye, SNH said.
Evidence gathered at Valtos has been used by palaeontologists to explain what has been called the Dino Stampede in Australia, an incident where a group of dinosaurs were pursued by a predator.
SNH said the Bearreraig Bay dig had been done without the landowner's permission or the consent of SNH, which manages the SSSI.
Dr Colin MacFadyen, SNH's geologist, also said the actions went against guidelines in the Scottish Fossil Code.
The codes does allow for the use of mechanical diggers, rock saws and even explosives for extracting fossils, but only when it was to the benefit of palaeontological research.
Dr MacFadyen said: ""Fossil collecting is important for scientific and educational purposes, and is a popular hobby.
""It is better for fossils that fall from cliffs to be found, collected and enjoyed rather than be eroded and washed away by the tide.
""However, speeding up the process by large scale rock removal as in this alarming case is irresponsible and illegal, and also potentially dangerous to people as the cliff faces are undermined and destabilised.""
Dr MacFadyen said permission to remove material from the SSSI would have been needed from SNH, but it had not been sought.
He said fossil-rich rock had been damaged at the Bearreraig Bay site.
Dr Neil Clark, of University of Glasgow's Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, has described Skye as one of the world's most important palaeontology sites.
Its standing is underlined by the number of finds from the Middle Jurassic, about 170 million years ago.
Dr Clark told the BBC News Scotland website: ""This is quite a shock. It is not something I have heard of happening before.
""Without knowing exactly where the damage is I can't say what they were after. It may have been plesiosaur.""
He added: ""Whatever has been taken is now lost to science.""
Finds on Skye have included the earliest turtles known to have lived in water.
The 164-million-year-old reptile fossils were found embedded in a block of rock at the bay of Cladach a'Ghlinne, on the Strathaird peninsula.
The new species formed a missing link between ancient terrestrial turtles and their modern, aquatic descendants.
The discovery of Eileanchelys waldmani, which translates as ""the turtle from the island"", was reported in the Royal Society journals in 2008.",Tonnes of rock has been disturbed at a Jurassic site on Skye in what has been described as one of Scotland's most reckless acts of fossil collecting.
40757119,"Police said the suspect was 26 years old and born in the United Arab Emirates. They said he acted alone and he was overpowered by passersby.
Mayor Olaf Scholz said the attack was motivated by ""hate"" but did not say it was a terror attack.
There are unconfirmed reports that the man shouted ""Allahu akhbar"", Arabic for ""God is great"" while attacking people.
Police said they were still seeking to confirm his current nationality. Mr Sholz said he was a failed asylum seeker.
The man attacked customers in the supermarket at random, ran outside and was chased by customers and by people outside the shop. They brought him to the ground before he was detained by plain-clothes police officers.
Mobile phone footage on German media that is purportedly of the attack's aftermath shows several people chasing a man and throwing chairs at him.
A 50-year-old woman and four men aged between 19 and 64 were stabbed, while a 35-year-old man was injured while helping overcome the suspect.
The attack happened in the Barmbek region in the north of the city in a branch of Edeka, Germany's largest supermarket chain.
Police say the man's weapon may have looked like a machete but they are, for now, assuming it was a kitchen knife.
One eyewitness made a gesture about 50cm (20 in) long when asked on German TV how big the knife was.
Asked whether this was a terror attack, a police official told the BBC: ""We are at an early stage of the investigation... At the moment we can't rule anything out. We are investigating all avenues.""
Speculation in German media said the attack may have been part of a robbery attempt but police said that that motive could not be confirmed.
One eyewitness, who ran from the scene into a nearby shop as the situation unfolded, told German broadcaster NTV that it seemed ""hectic and confused, not like a properly planned attack"".",A 50-year-old German man has been killed and six people injured in a knife attack in a Hamburg supermarket.
36110822,"The claim: ""We are giving £20bn a year or £350m a week to Brussels.""
Reality Check verdict: We are not giving £20bn a year or £350m a week to Brussels - Britain pays £276m a week to the EU budget because of the rebate.
He has gone with that figure despite a letter from the head of the UK statistics watchdog Sir Andrew Dilnot on Thursday, which described it as ""potentially misleading"".
The figure used is roughly the UK's gross contribution to the EU - the amount that would be contributed to the EU Budget were it not for the rebate.
We say ""roughly the UK's gross contribution"" because the annual figure that Boris Johnson used was £20bn, somewhat higher than the £18.8bn figure for 2014 - the most recent figure available - while the £350m a week figure is a bit below the actual figure of £361m.
The important point is that it's not the sum we send to Brussels because the rebate is deducted before any money is paid. In 2014, the UK's contribution to the EU budget - the amount we paid to Brussels - was actually £276m a week.
If Britain were to give up the rebate, then the UK would have to pay the gross contribution, and it should be noted that the rebate is not a permanent feature of Britain's membership of the EU.
But we do not pay the gross contribution at the moment, the rebate is safe until 2020, and Britain has a veto over the process that would remove or reduce it.
Sir Andrew Dilnot is particularly concerned about suggestions from Vote Leave that a sum of money equivalent to the gross contribution could be spent on other priorities such as the NHS, when some of it is not spent at all (the rebate) and some of it is currently used to support UK farmers, for example.

38539371,"Abel Hernandez was the hero for the hosts, scoring twice on his first start since injuring his groin against Southampton on 6 November.
That match against the Saints was the final league victory under Silva's predecessor Mike Phelan, who was dismissed on 3 January with the team bottom of the league.
Hull have now won twice in three games under former Olympiakos and Sporting Lisbon boss Silva, having beaten Swansea in the FA Cup third round a week ago.
Tyrone Mings' own goal added gloss to the scoreline for Hull, who took a long time to grow into the match after falling behind to Junior Stanislas' third-minute penalty, awarded for Harry Maguire's challenge on Ryan Fraser and the 10th the Tigers have conceded in 21 games this season.
Bournemouth have now shipped three goals in eight of their last 10 games in all competitions, and drop to 11th place after their 10th defeat of the campaign.
It has been a bleak winter for Hull so far and the loss of £10m striker Hernandez to injury certainly contributed to their plight.
The Tigers went nine games without a win during his absence, dropping them to the bottom of the table by Christmas and culminating in the departure of Phelan early in the new year.
His return has coincided with the appointment of Silva, and it has quickly become apparent that the influence of both could prove vital in turning Hull's season around.
The 26-year-old's goal against Swansea in the cup was a timely reminder of the ability that brought him 20 goals in Hull's promotion campaign last season, and his first against Bournemouth bore all the predatory instincts that the hosts have been missing these past few weeks.
Huge credit must go to Andrew Robertson for the quality of his cross from the left wing, which presented Hernandez with a headed chance from around a yard out that he simply could not miss.
The second was more of a self-made effort, the Uruguay international picking the ball up on the right, advancing into the area and selling a couple of cute stepovers to Mings before curling a precise finish into the left-hand corner.

It was a huge result for Hull but also a significant one for the visitors, who have now conceded 24 goals in their last 10 league and cup games.
Their mid-table position - and nine-point gap to the drop zone - means Bournemouth have some wiggle room as they bid to shore up at the back.
But they cannot continue to leak goals at the present rate and not expect to find themselves flirting with danger at the end of the season.
Hull's third goal here was certainly unfortunate - Mings diverting in Tom Huddlestone's hopeful shot from the edge of the area - but nevertheless continues a sequence of results that is clearly worrying boss Eddie Howe, who conceded that there was a ""pattern emerging"".
Hull head coach Marco Silva: ""I'm happy because what I saw was a team with big spirit and big character. That's important for me.
""After 10-15 minutes it was difficult, but we started to control the game and put the other team back. The first 25-30 minutes of the second half it was all our team.
""I start to see [progress]. We have time next week to work more and the players now believe more in our ideas.
""I saw my players smile in the dressing room and that's important for me.""
Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: ""We got the perfect start and from that point we were looking to consolidate and then it slipped away. The second half was tough to watch.

""He's got the quality and can score goals out of nothing.""
Kaikai, who scored on his only appearances to date for Palace in their League Cup tie against Newcastle in September 2014, first moved to Greenhous Meadow last September and scored five times in 17 games before returning to Selhurst Park at the start of January.
Since coming back to Shropshire the goals have flowed, leading Shrewsbury boss Micky Mellon to question why he has not been part of the England Under-21 squad.

The next clear cut chance came just before the half time whistle. Jordan Marshall slipped away from his marker, he whipped in a great ball from the left, but Dobbie couldn't get his head to it.
The breakthrough came in the second half with Cairney's goal, and Ayr could have doubled their lead through Gary Harkins.
The striker had time, but failed to get the shot on target and launched the ball over the bar.
Ayr United move up to sixth spot in the Championship, with Queens now down to third after their second defeat in a row.

22377560,"Two army generals, a ruling coalition MP and an opposition MP had been arrested over the alleged plot, the officials added.
A ""small group"" conspired for four months, the officials said.
Chad, a staunch ally of France, has a long history of coups and revolts.
Mr Deby himself seized power in a coup in 1990.
The BBC's Nathalie Magnien in N'Djamena says it is business as usual in the capital and no-one seems particularly concerned about the news.
There is no visible sign of increased security in the city or patrols on the streets, she says.
""Between four and eight people were killed in fighting at a military barracks in the east of N'Djamena,"" said a police source who requested anonymity, Reuters news agency reports.
By Celeste HicksFormer BBC Chad correspondent
Chadians are used to news of suspected coups - power has never changed hands peacefully and President Idriss Deby Itno is constantly aware that a soldier or even someone in his own family could overthrow him.
It is not yet clear who was behind this ""attempt at destabilisation"". Government sources say the main figure arrested is Saleh Makki, a hitherto relatively unknown member of the political opposition with no association with rebels in the past.
Some are speculating that there may be a connection to Chad's recent military interventions abroad and President Deby recently accused Libya of supporting militias against him. Recent threats from the former Chadian rebel group UFR do not carry much weight as they are a spent force.
What is known is that it is very difficult for the opposition to win an election - weak and divided they boycotted the 2011 presidential vote which Mr Deby won with 83%.
Mr Deby changed the constitution to abolish presidential term limits in 2005.
Police sources told the AFP news agency a shoot-out took place on the outskirts of N'Djamena, with three members of the security forces being among the dead.
""A small group of ill-intentioned individuals attempted to carry out a destabilisation plot against the institutions of the republic,"" a government statement said.
It said that the country's security forces ""neutralised"" them, without specifying how many people were involved in the alleged action.
Prosecutor Mahamat Saleh Youssouf named the generals who had been arrested as Weiddig Assi Assoue and Ngomine Beadmadji David.
Ruling coalition MP Mahamat Malloum and opposition MP Saleh Makki had also been arrested, he said.
Mr Makki's coalition Co-ordination of Political Parties for the Defence of the Constitution (CPDC), told the BBC it was confused by his arrest.
Mr Makki was arrested by police between 21:00 and 22:00 local time on Wednesday evening, his wife told the CPDC.
Our reporter says it is not clear what charges they will face.
Since its independence from France in 1960, Chad's history has been marked by instability and violence stemming mostly from tension between the mainly Arab-Muslim north and the predominantly Christian and animist south.
Mr Deby has survived two attacks on the capital - in 2006 and 2008 - from rebels in eastern Chad.
These rebels were supported by Sudan's government, which was unhappy that Darfuri rebels were using eastern Chad as a base. But a rapprochement between Chad and Sudan in 2010 has helped bring peace to that region.
Earlier this year, Chad deployed some 2,000 troops to help French forces oust Islamists who had seized large swathes of territory in Mali.
France said it had noted the latest events in Chad ""with concern"" and called on the government and opposition to engage in  ""calm and constructive dialogue"", AFP reports.","At least four people were killed in Chad's capital, N'Djamena, as government forces foiled a ""destabilisation plot"" against President Idriss Deby, officials said."
35749065,"The latest round of bloody protests over Oromo rights had a tragically surreal beginning.
A bus filled with a wedding party taking the bride to the groom's home was stopped at a routine checkpoint on 12 February near the southern Ethiopian town of Shashamane.
Local police told revellers to turn off the nationalistic Oromo music playing. They refused and the bus drove off.
The situation then rapidly escalated and reports indicate at least one person died and three others were injured after police fired shots.
The exact details of the incident are hard to verify, but what is clear is that days of protest followed, including armed local militia clashing with federal police, leaving seven policemen dead, the government says.
Oromia at a glance:
Why Ethiopia is making a historic ‘master plan’ U-turn
Since last November, Ethiopia has seen a third phase of the recent unrest in the Oromia region which has been unprecedented in its longevity and geographical spread.
The region is the largest in Ethiopia and the Oromos, who make up a third of the population, are the biggest of the country's more than 80 ethnic groups.
Initially the protests were in reaction to a plan to expand the administrative border of the capital, Addis Ababa, which is encircled by Oromia.
But even after the region's governing party, the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation, which is part of Ethiopia's governing coalition, shelved the plan in January, protests have continued.
""There is a strong sense of victimhood, extending back 150 years,"" says Daniel Berhane, a prominent Addis Ababa-based political blogger, covering Ethiopia for the website Horn Affairs.
""People remember the history. The scars are still alive, such as how the Oromo language was suppressed until 20 years ago.""
Despite there being an ethnic basis to these protests, observers say that the deeper issues behind them, frustrations over land ownership, corruption, political and economic marginalisation, are familiar to many disenchanted Ethiopians.
The numbers killed since November following clashes between protesters and security forces given by international rights organisations, activists and observers range from 80 to 250.
The government has dismissed various death tolls as exaggerations, and said that a recent report on the situation by the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) was an ""absolute lie"".
Ethiopian citizens had a right to question the plan to expand Addis Ababa, but the protests were hijacked by people looking to incite violence, according to government spokesman Getachew Reda.
He says the security forces have faced ""organised armed gangs burning down buildings belonging to private citizens, along with government installations"".
A security analyst who closely watches Ethiopia says ""there could be radical elements and factions taking advantage, but you cannot define a movement by isolated events"".
Despite violent incidents, the protests have been described as ""largely peaceful"" by HRW and observers in Ethiopia.
""There is a perception of lack of competence in governance on the ground,"" Mr Daniel says.
""There were easy remedies to appease initial protests, it was not hard science, but the right actions were not taken.""
In its defence, the government says it heeded the call of the people when it came to concerns over the Addis Ababa plan, and observers say the government deserves credit for withdrawing it.
But the same political observers add that the government must allow Ethiopians to exercise their constitutional right to protest, and handle events in a way that does not escalate violence.
The government has said that the protests and information about them have been manipulated by foreign-based opposition groups who are using social media to exaggerate what is going on for their own ends.
""The diaspora magnifies news of what is happening, yes, but no matter how much it agitates, it cannot direct [what's happening] at village level in Ethiopia,"" says Jawar Mohammed, executive director of one of those accused of fomenting conflict, US-based broadcaster Oromia Media Network (OMN).
""This is about dissatisfaction.""
Mr Jawar says the imprisonment of leaders of the Oromo Federalist Congress party, Oromia's largest legally registered opposition political party, along with thousands of other Oromo political prisoners, makes it difficult to negotiate a lasting solution.
""Also what is the UK and US doing? As major donors to Ethiopia they should be taking the lead to get the government to work out an agreement.""
This is a long way from the heady days of Ethiopia's new federal constitution after the overthrow of the military dictatorship in 1991.
That introduced a decentralised system of ethnic federalism, but this jars with the dominance of the governing Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which, along with its allies, holds every seat in parliament.
""The ruling government is a victim of its own success,"" the security analyst says.
""The constitution it developed made promises and people trusted the EPRDF. Now people are demanding those rights and the government is responding with bullets and violence.""
He adds that the government has expanded basic services and infrastructure, and appears to respect different cultural and ethnic identities, but it cannot reconcile this with its more authoritarian decision-making process.
The government's hitherto successful job of holding together this particularly heterogeneous federation is not about to crumble, according to observers here.
But things may get worse before they get better, unless underlying sources of friction and frustration are addressed.","As protests in Ethiopia over the rights of the country's Oromo people continue, Addis Ababa-based journalist James Jeffrey considers if they are threatening the country's unity."
37983593,"The government last year pledged £1.4bn for child mental health by 2020, but a report says millions of pounds is being used to offset NHS cuts elsewhere.
Specialist teams are also turning away up to a quarter of youngsters, it said.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government was ""determined to address"" mental health problems.
The previous coalition government promised in 2015 an extra £250m a year during this parliament to improve mental health services for children in England.
However, Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb - who was a health minister at the time - has now overseen a report by an independent commission that says much of the money has failed to reach the areas where it is most needed.
The report - by the Education Policy Institute Independent Commission on Children and Young People's Mental Health - says only £75m made it to the clinical commissioning groups who pay for services last year.
The commission says young people are still struggling to access help - partly because of difficulties in recruiting staff, including mental health nurses and psychiatrists.
According to the report, specialist services are turning away 23% of children and young people referred to them, often because there are ""high thresholds"" for accessing services.
The authors warned that ""something has to go drastically wrong before some services will intervene"".
The report challenged Theresa May to develop a ""prime minister's challenge on children's mental health"", similar to former PM David Cameron's ""dementia challenge"", which led to increases in investment and awareness.
Mr Lamb, chairman of the commission, said: ""The prime minister, in her very first speech, rightly highlighted the inadequacies of the country's mental health provision as a 'burning injustice'.
""Today we call on the government to meet this commitment - and take urgent action to ensure children and young people with mental health problems receive the care they need.""
Bev Humphrey, chairwoman of the Mental Health Network - which represents mental health and learning disability service providers in England - said the government had failed ""to come close to fulfilling its existing promises on mental health funding"".
""This situation means underfunded NHS and social services are struggling to help the growing number of children experiencing serious mental health problems.
""With many services almost at breaking point the commission is right - it really is time to deliver.""
Mr Hunt said mental health services for children remained a priority and further plans to improve care would be announced ""soon"".
""We are already investing £1.4bn to help make sure children get the right care and every area in the country has put together plans on how they will spend the money to transform children's mental health services.
""We are also strengthening the links between schools and mental health services, and driving forward innovation to improve prevention and early support.""","Money earmarked to boost mental health provision for children in England is failing to make it to front-line services, a new report suggests."

35509296,"Cardiff hit the woodwork twice as Joe Ralls smashed the post with a long-range first-half strike and Anthony Pilkington hit the bar with a volley.
Johnnie Jackson wasted a good opening as the Charlton captain headed over Johann Berg Gudmundsson's cross.
And Charlton's Simon Makienok missed two late chances as Cardiff hung on.
The Bluebirds were reduced to 10 men for the final minute of injury time after midfielder Sammy Ameobi was dismissed for a second yellow card.
The point moves Charlton off the bottom table but they are now six points from safety after MK Dons and Bristol City both won.
It was a battle of the sides with controversial owners and in a week where Vincent Tan vowed to halve Cardiff's £140m debt, Charlton fans handed out 2,000 Pinocchio masks and stickers before kick-off in the latest protest at Addicks owner Roland Duchatelet.
And their mood would not have been helped if Anthony Pilkington's header had not been deflected over with barely a minute on the clock.
Ameobi and a Peter Whittingham free-kick went close for Cardiff before midfielder Ralls' 25-yard shot cannoned back off the post.
Charlton's Reza Ghoochannejhad tested Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall before an unmarked Jackson headed Gudmundsson's corner into the ground and over.
Pilkington twice worried the Charton defence either side of the interval before the Cardiff striker hit the crossbar when his clever flick from Scott Malone's cross had home keeper Stephen Henderson beaten.
But Charlton, with the second worst defensive record in the league, held firm and the hosts could have won their first home game since early November in added time.
Zakarya Bergdich forced Marshall into a smart save before Cardiff defender Bruno Ecuele Manga cleared Makienok's effort off the line as the Welsh side drew their 13th match this season, the joint highest in the whole league.
Charlton head coach Jose Riga:

""Cardiff deserved to win the game, but for me the most important was to see a reaction from my players. The way we played pleased me a lot.
""Now we must make sure we keep this up in the next game. With these efforts we will get what we deserve.
I'm realistic. Results have not been the best, but what can we do?
""If you think and act like a team you can do a lot things. I believe in work, commitment and I always stay optimistic. It's a step forward.""
Cardiff City manager Russell Slade said:
""We opened up in an effort to try and win three points rather than take just one. We had something like 22 shots and if there's any criticism we've probably only had three or four on target and that is what cost us dearly.
""We felt it was two points dropped massively. We were in some good situations and it was the final shot or pass that let us down. We didn't have the final ruthless streak which was going to bring us home the three points.
""The Ameobi red card was a little bit soft and it's a disappointing.""

30552148,"Mr Gulen, who is in self-imposed exile in the US, is accused of establishing and running an ""armed terrorist group"".
He was once an ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan but has now been accused of plotting to overthrow the Turkish government - a claim the cleric strongly denies.
The US is thought to be unlikely to act on any extradition request.
The move comes amid a national crackdown on perceived supporters of the cleric.
Over 20 journalists working for media outlets thought to be sympathetic to the Gulen movement were arrested last weekend.
Eight of them were freed on Friday on the orders of a court in Istanbul. Those released include Ekrem Dumanli, editor-in-chief of Zaman newspaper.
Four others, including a TV station boss, remain in custody.
According to the BBC's Mark Lowen in Istanbul, it was expected that the authorities would go after Mr Gulen after having targeted those linked to him.
While the US and Turkey have an extradition agreement, the warrant is considered to be largely symbolic - and unlikely to be acted upon.
The relationship between Washington and Ankara has grown fractious, though they remain allies.
Mr Erdogan has faced criticism from international leaders and his opponents, who accuse him of authoritarianism and undermining free press.
Many abroad believe that the charges against Mr Gulen are politically motivated.
The wealthy cleric, who operates an international network of schools and businesses, has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999.

But there was support for the idea of more powers being devolved to the Welsh Assembly, with 49% in favour.
ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,006 people in Wales over the telephone.
The survey found 12% wanted to see the assembly abolished.
The poll also found growing support for UKIP in Wales ahead of next year's general election.
Nigel Farage's party is on 14%, up seven points from the last BBC Wales poll in March.
Labour are down four points to 38%, with the Conservatives on 23% (down one), Plaid Cymru on 13% (down one) and the Liberal Democrats on 7% (down two).
Prof Roger Scully of the Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University said: ""Support for independence is the lowest I've seen anywhere.
""There has been a clear move towards supporting more powers, and some of the people who may have said 'independence' have gone in that direction.
""We're getting close to a majority saying they want things to go further.  There are also pretty low levels of support for abolition of the assembly - the extreme positions are losing out.""
An analysis of the voting intention figures by Prof Scully suggests that, on a uniform swing, Labour would gain two seats in the capital - Cardiff North and Cardiff Central - at next May's general election.
The Conservatives would lose Cardiff North but gain Brecon and Radnor; Plaid Cymru would retain their three seats but the Liberal Democrats would be reduced to a solitary Welsh seat at Westminster - Ceredigion.
UKIP's level of support is too low to win their own seat, but high enough to have an impact on some marginal constituencies.
""UKIP's support is clearly going up,"" said Prof Scully.  ""They are starting to reach the sort of level where they could make a serious difference in marginal seats.""
He said most evidence suggests they are taking more support from the Conservatives than anywhere else, which could be of importance in Tory-held marginal seats like the Vale of Glamorgan and Aberconwy.

He also said savings put aside for a deposit by first-time buyers would be topped up by the government - to the tune of £50 for every £200 saved - in a move that will come into force this Autumn. The new Help to Buy ISA accounts will be made available through banks and building societies.
Other measures include:
Mr Osborne hailed slightly better than expected growth figures, which suggest the economy will expand by 2.5% this year, rather than 2.4% and described his economic package as a ""Budget for Britain - a comeback country"".
He said the government had met its 2010 target to end this Parliament with Britain's national debt falling as a share of GDP, meaning the ""the hard work and sacrifice of the British people has paid off"".

Setting out his plans in the Commons, Mr Osborne said: ""We took difficult decisions in the teeth of opposition and it worked. Britain is walking tall again.
""Five years ago, our economy had suffered a collapse greater than almost any country.
""Today, I can confirm: in the last year we have grown faster than any other major advanced economy in the world.""
He said he would use a boost in the public finances caused by lower inflation and welfare payments to pay off some of the national debt and end the squeeze on public spending a year earlier than planned.
In 2019/20 spending will grow in line with the growth of the economy - bringing state spending as a share of national income to the same level as in 2000, the chancellor told MPs.
The BBC's Robert Peston said this was a move aimed at neutralising Labour's claim that the Conservatives would cut spending to 1930s levels.
But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the Treasury's own figures showed spending at the ""lowest level since 1938"" in 2018/19 while the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, in its analysis, said Mr Osborne's plans implied a ""rollercoaster profile"" for expenditure over the next five years.
Mr Osborne insisted that deficit reduction remained his top priority but also unveiled measures aimed at increasing the amount people can earn before paying tax to £10,800 next year and an above inflation rise to £43,300 by 2017 for the amount people can earn before having to pay the 40p tax rate.
Some of the plans in Mr Osborne's statement are likely to depend on a Conservative victory on 7 May. Whoever wins the election is likely to set out another Budget later this year.
If you think getting the debt down is the big priority, the last five years have seen a good deal of austerity for very delayed gain.
It is taking precisely twice as long as George Osborne hoped to get the debt down to 70% of GDP.
And to achieve that deferred gain, the Office for Budget Responsibility says the acuteness of austerity will get worse, before it gets a lot better.

Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed the Conservatives had a ""secret plan"" to cut the NHS because they would not be able to deliver their planned ""colossal cuts"" to other areas of public spending and they would also be forced to increase VAT.
He said Labour would reverse the tax cuts for millionaires and introduce a mansion tax to fund the NHS.
He also pledged to abolish the ""vindictive and unfair"" housing benefit changes he calls the ""bedroom tax"".
The SNP said Mr Osborne had ""blown his last chance"" to deliver for Scotland.
SNP deputy leader and Treasury spokesman Stewart Hosie said: ""Today George Osborne could have delivered a Budget focused on delivering economic growth by tackling inequality.
""He has not - he has decided to continue with his utterly failed austerity agenda.""
The chancellor sprayed largesse far and wide - on drinkers and drivers, orchestras and air ambulances, churches and charities.
So yes no massive giveaway, no massive rabbit, as some Tory MPs had wanted, but a glimpse of better things to come and the road - as Mr Osborne put it - from austerity to prosperity. But the essential political argument hasn't changed.

UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said: ""Mr Osborne talks about a long-term economic plan, today he pushed all his targets back and created a long grass economic plan.""
Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said the chancellor's ""triumphalist tone"" would ""leave a bad taste in the mouth"" of people on zero hours contracts or struggling to put food on the table.
Plaid Cymru Treasury spokesman Jonathan Edwards said: ""This was a 'jam tomorrow' Budget from a chancellor who is busy sharpening the axe ready for the next Parliament.""
Mr Osborne's sixth Budget statement came against a backdrop of a strengthening economic recovery, a fresh fall in unemployment and a rosier picture expected as a result of falling oil prices dragging down inflation.
In was, in parts, an openly electioneering Budget, with Mr Osborne saying: ""The critical choice facing the country now is this: do we return to the chaos of the past? Or do we say to the British people, let's work through the plan that is delivering for you?""
The Budget was largely welcomed by business leaders with CBI Director General John Cridland saying it would provide the ""stability and consistency"" needed to boost growth.
The trade unions were less impressed, with the TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady saying: ""He did not spell out where, if re-elected, he will make the huge spending cuts he plans for the next Parliament, nor did he tell Britain's low paid workers which of their benefits he will cut.""","George Osborne has announced tax cuts for first-time buyers, workers and savers in his final Budget before May's general election."
35091680,"A security source told the BBC that at least 35 soldiers and allied Sunni tribesmen were killed in a series of suicide car bomb attacks.
A senior IS leader was also said to have been killed east of the city.
Government forces have encircled Ramadi and are preparing for a final assault on the city, which IS overran in May.
Last week, troops retook the key western district of Tamim, which is only separated from the city centre by a tributary of the Euphrates, and the headquarters of the Iraqi military's Anbar Operations Command.
On Monday, a senior source in the Anbar Operations Command said IS militants launched a wave of attacks across Ramadi as they tried to regain areas recently recaptured by government forces.
Five suicide bombers drove cars packed with explosives at government positions, including those in the northern district of Albu Farraj, killing more than 20 soldiers and tribesmen, the source added.
At least 15 militants were subsequently killed in a gun battle, before Iraqi and US-led air strikes forced the rest of the attackers to retreat.
A sixth suicide car bomb attack, in south-western Ramadi, killed another 15 soldiers and tribesmen, the source said.
Iraqi media also reported that an IS leader in charge of setting up car bombs had been killed along with four of his aides in a military operation in the Jazirat al-Khalidiya area, 12 miles (20km) east of Ramadi.
Security sources identified the militant as Ibrahim al-Halabi, a Syrian national.
The US military believes there are between 600 and 1,000 IS militants in Ramadi.
It says they have developed a strong defensive system in and around the city, including using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to create minefields.","Islamic State militants have reportedly launched several counter-attacks in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, which government forces are trying to recapture."
37481256,"About 80,000 lightning strikes were recorded, some damaging power generation facilities, while winds toppled over 22 transmission towers.
Power was restored to Adelaide area by 03:00 local time (17:30 GMT) but tens of thousands of homes remain cut off.
On Thursday, authorities advised people to leave work early as winds were expected to intensify again.
How 'unprecedented' storm played out
The state premier said ""twin tornadoes"" had hit northern areas in ""an extreme weather event"" on Wednesday. Jay Weatherill compared the storm to Hurricane Sandy which hit New York in 2012.
He said officials in charges of the power grid had told him ""any system would not be able to cope with a weather system of this kind"".
""We had winds which were so strong that when they hit power lines they created such energy they were tearing the towers out of the ground.""
While South Australia's wild weather was widely forecast, no-one could really predict the impact it would have on everyday life.
In Adelaide, commuters were left feeling their way in the dark as the lights went off on their way home. Gridlock followed, as trains and trams came to a standstill.
At the airport, some passengers had to depend on handwritten boarding passes, after power for the printers failed. Some describe the whole experience as ""apocalyptic"", while one woman, who was on the operating table in the local hospital and about to undergo surgery, said it was simply ""funny"".
What has been predictable is that an extreme weather event has very quickly turned into an Australian political storm, with the state's dependency on renewable energy now being debated with the full force and bluster of a tornado.
The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said the storm was a once-in-50-years event.
It is forecasting further heavy rainfall throughout Thursday and into Friday. Further gales of up to 140km/h (87mph) are expected, and flood warnings remain in place.
On Thursday, South Australia's State Emergency Service has warned residents to prepare for more high winds and rain, cautioning there was ""a potentially very dangerous"" weather system gathering, with winds of up to 125km/h (78mph) predicted.
""As the winds increase, rainfall intensity is also expected to increase,"" said Chief Officer Chris Beattie.
""High tides this afternoon and evening will result in significant storm surges"" he added, recommending that workers go home early.
Influential South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon has called for a independent inquiry.
""This is a disgrace. How did this happen? How is an entire state blacked out?"" he said.
The Australian Energy Market Operator, which controls the nation's electricity network, said it was still working to understand the cause of the fault.
It urged Australians to ""take care during this outage and to follow the safety advice and guidelines issued by the South Australian government and emergency services"".","South Australia is enduring a second day of severe weather, after the entire state was left without power overnight."

34231620,"The huge red crane crashed into a part of the Grand Mosque as it was filled with worshippers, less than two weeks before the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Officials say strong winds and heavy rains caused the crane to fall.
Correspondents say there have previously been concerns about safety on Saudi construction sites.
The Grand Mosque, known as the Masjid al-Haram, is the largest mosque in the world and surrounds Islam's holiest place, the Kaaba.
At least 230 people were injured in the incident. It is unclear how many people were hurt by the collapse or the stampede that followed it.
Those killed are reported to include Indonesian, Indian, Iranian and Egyptian citizens.
The incident happened at 17:23 local time (14:23 GMT) on Friday.
Videos posted online showed the moment the structure collapsed, with a loud crash followed by panic and shouting. Bodies and blood could be seen on the floor of the mosque.
The head of Saudi Arabia's civil defence agency, Lt Sulayman Bin-Abdullah al-Amr, said an investigation was being carried out to assess the damage, and the ""extent of the safety of these sites"".
Essam al-Ghalib, a Jeddah-based journalist, said the crane fell through the outer ring of the Grand Mosque and punctured through the roof sending down tonnes of cement and debris onto people either praying or walking through.
Up to two million people are expected to arrive in Mecca for the Hajj from all over the world later this month.
Saudi officials say the crane disaster will not prevent the Hajj going ahead.
Irfan Al-Alawi, from the Islamic Heritage Research Foundation, told the BBC that the Grand Mosque is currently surrounded by 15 large cranes amid major redevelopment work.
""The entire area is like a salvage yard,"" Mr Al-Alawi said.
""Saudi Arabia has to re-think its health and safety strategy,"" he said, ""as there were 800,000 people in the mosque area at the time of the accident.""
The original parts of the Grand Mosque date back 1,400 years. Consisting of a large square surrounded by covered prayer areas, the building has since been extensively modernised, notably from the mid-20th Century.
Saudi authorities began a major expansion of the site last year to increase the area of the mosque by 400,000 square metres (4.3 million square feet), to allow it to accommodate up to 2.2 million people at once.","Saudi Arabia has begun an investigation into why a crane collapsed in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, killing at least 107 people."

However, the service at Jasenovac was boycotted by Jewish and Serb groups.
They say the new Croat government has not acted against renewed use of Ustashe salutes by nationalists.
In January, ultra-nationalists shouted pro-Nazi slogans at a rally attended by thousands of people, including Deputy Parliamentary Speaker Ivan Tepes.
Similar slogans were also chanted during a football match between Israel and Croatia in March, attended by Prime Minister Tihomir Oreskovic.
Croatia's Jewish community held a separate Holocaust commemoration a week ago.
Mr Oreskovic and President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic both voiced regret over the boycott.
Earlier this month they explicitly condemned the Ustashe regime's crimes for the first time during a visit by Nicholas Dean, the US State Department's special envoy for Holocaust issues.

But after he died in a plane crash, former property investor Chris Welsh, who is based in California, bought the submarine and is now taking on the lonely challenge himself.
Chris said: ""I've been working day and night for two years pursuing this. I'm really excited to get out there and do it - I can't wait.
""The rewards of this is breaking ground in so many ways - in raw human exploration, on bringing back science, and in getting a better understanding of our world.""
The experimental sub was created and built by British engineer Graham Hawkes.
Fitted with wings and a tail fin, its design is based on that of a plane.
Chris Welsh hopes to ""fly"" down to the bottom of the trench, and break the record for the first lone dive there, later this year.

31499189,"In a letter urging congregations to vote on 7 May, the House of Bishops does not endorse a political party but encourages debate on issues such as nuclear defence and the economy.
It speaks of Britain's ""almost moribund political culture"".
Conservative MP Conor Burns said the letter was ""naive"", but David Cameron said he welcomed the move.
The 52-page letter - an unprecedented intervention by the House of Bishops - says ""it is the duty of every Christian adult to vote, even though it may have to be a vote for something less than a vision that inspires us"".
The Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham James, said there was ""disengagement with the contemporary political culture"" and rejected the pleas of some, such as comedian and actor Russell Brand, for people not to vote.
He told reporters: ""We as bishops are not as sexy as Russell Brand but we say 'do vote, do engage and do use the hard-won political freedoms that you possess'.""
The letter says the country needs ""a new approach to political life that will change the political weather as decisively as did the administrations of 1945 and 1979"".
""The ideals that the Big Society stood for should not be consigned to the political dustbin,"" the letter adds.
The Big Society was among the Conservatives' flagship 2010 election policies and encouraged greater personal responsibility and community activism in shaping society and running public services.
But by January 2013 charities expressed ""huge frustration"" at a lack of progress with the idea, which they said appeared to be ""going nowhere"".
The document covers various issues including:
The bishops are well aware that their pre-election letter will be seen by some as a left-wing document - although they have been at pains to stress that their intention is not to back one party over another, nor to create a wish-list of policies - although they do ask voters to back the ""living wage"".
They say that the two UK administrations that offered genuinely new visions - Clement Attlee's Labour party in 1945 and Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives in 1979 - changed the way people in Britain looked at society, politics and the role of government and human relationships - but that today, neither vision addresses contemporary needs, at a time of increasing public alienation from mainstream politics.
In recent weeks, the Archbishops of York and Canterbury have asked questions about the increasing divides between North and South, or richest and poorest in the UK.
So this latest intervention, questioning what kind of society an increasingly diverse Britain wants to be, and what kind of power it wishes to wield on the world stage, is a sign of a Church more willing to use its position to speak truth unto power, even if it is not always welcomed.
Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said she believed the letter had ""glaring inaccuracies"" regarding the economy and the Church should be more concerned with issues people wanted to hear its views on, such as abortion.
She said the bishops had a ""very definite left-wing leaning to their message"".
However, the prime minister said he was ""keen for anyone to intervene in politics"".
Mr Cameron said: ""We want to have a political debate in this country.
""We've created an economy with genuine growth, real jobs and real security and I would say to the bishops, I would hope they would welcome that.""
Labour leader Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have not commented on the letter.
But Stephen Timms, Labour's shadow employment minister, tweeted that he welcomed the ""thoughtful and authentically Christian reflection on the election debate"".
Conor Burns, MP for Bournemouth West, said the letter was ""naive"" in not taking into account the recession and the risk posed by countries like Iran.
Paul Whiteley, professor of government at the University of Essex, said the letter's policies were a combination of the Green Party, SNP and ""perhaps a bit of Labour"".
He said it had been a ""long time since the Church of England aligned with the Conservative Party"".
The director of public affairs for the Archbishops' Council, Malcolm Brown, rejected suggestions the letter was an attack on coalition policies and criticised responses to the document.
""The media response is to interpret it as an attack on the coalition,"" he said.
""David Cameron has reacted as if the letter was a rehash of earlier disputes about welfare reform.
""In short, the bishops have been thoroughly vindicated. If the responses of the media and the PM are typical of our political culture, it is unfit for purpose.""","Politicians need to deliver a ""fresh moral vision"" ahead of the general election, the Church of England says."
20121664,"The 28-mile road - previously predicted to cost £347m - was given the green light by Scottish ministers in 2009, but was delayed by legal action.
Protesters lost their appeal to the Supreme Court earlier this month.
Transport Minister Keith Brown said the ""unwanted delays"" had resulted in a ""substantial increase"" in the overall cost of the project.
William Walton from the protest group RoadSense, which spearheaded the legal challenge against the construction of the bypass, told BBC Scotland he believed the total cost could be even higher.
It is anticipated that construction will get under way in 2014, with completion by spring 2018.
In answer to a parliamentary question lodged by Aberdeen Central SNP MSP Kevin Stewart, Mr Brown said the scheme had been costed at £347m in 2008 - an estimate based on 2003 prices.
He said that the figure had now risen to £653m as a result of ""scope changes, the inclusion of standard risk costs and rebasing to 2012 prices"".
Mr Brown said inflation had been responsible for a £230m increase in the cost.
A scheme to make the A90 a dual carriageway between Balmedie and Tipperty in Aberdeenshire is also expected to cost £92m, giving a total of £745m for the combined project.
Mr Stewart criticised the added costs caused by the legal challenges.
He said: ""Not only has an essential piece of infrastructure been delayed unnecessarily, but inflation has driven up costs.
""Now that the legal challenges have been exhausted, we can now move towards construction as quickly as possible.""
Aberdeen City Council leader Barney Crockett said: ""We realised that the cost of the AWPR (Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route) would be roughly what it now is and we have made adequate provision for that.
""The economic performance of the area will be underpinned by the AWPR.""
Tom Smith, chairman of Aberdeen City and Shire Economic Future (Acsef) business development agency, said: ""The delays caused by the legal challenges were always going to impact on the costs outlined in 2003.
""However, the economic and other benefits of the road are so significant that the cost will still represent a major return on investment for the public purse and people of the north east.
""The final mechanics of how they will be paid are still being worked out and there will be delicate negotiations between the Scottish government and our local authorities.
""But with the Scottish government paying 80% of the route and the total cost of the fast-link, the north east is getting a great deal in terms of investment in our woefully under-invested roads infrastructure.""","The cost of the Aberdeen bypass has risen to an estimated £653m, it has been revealed."

He said a follow-up, Elstree 1979, would focus on the stunt team from Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back.
Filming is due to start this summer with the filmmakers hoping to release the documentary next year.
It is being produced by the Works Film Group.  However, it has not yet been decided whether there will be a second Kickstarter campaign.
Mr Spira said: ""Where '76 dealt with the supporting artists of A New Hope, this film will look at the stunt team from Empire Strikes Back.
""Wider than that, we will tell the story of that generation of British stunt performers. We can't wait to start shooting it.""
The first film featured Star Wars legends such as Dave Prowse, who played Darth Vader, and Jeremy Bulloch, who played Boba Fett, alongside little known extras.
Elstree 1979 will look at the work of stuntmen Colin Skeaping and Vic Armstrong, and recreate the scene in which Luke Skywalker is blown through a window during the film's climactic duel.

35050990,"With the PM away on his EU renegotiation tour, the shadow first secretary of state clashed with the chancellor for the first time, quoting Tory MPs unhappy at his progress.
Mr Osborne questioned the wisdom of quoting backbenchers in a dig at the unrest in Labour ranks.
He also pledged £50m in flood relief.
Mr Cameron is attempting to secure reforms to the UK's relationship with the EU before holding an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.
Ms Eagle, who was greeted with loud cheers as she stood up at the despatch box, said Mr Cameron had been ""jetting all over the place"" on his ""seemingly endless European tour"", adding to laughter from Labour ranks: ""Can I ask the chancellor: How's it all going?""
""The good news is we have a leader who is respected abroad,"" replied Mr Osborne, saying the PM was ""fighting for a better deal for Britain, something that would never have happened had there been a Labour government"".
George Osborne, the bookies' favourite to replace David Cameron as Conservative leader, was then asked whether he really aspired to be ""the first post-EU prime minister"" by Ms Eagle, who quoted some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs as being ""pretty unimpressed by how it's going"".
She then imitated Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's PMQs approach of reading out questions from emails he has received.
In this case it was ""Donald from Brussels"" - a reference to EU Council president Donald Tusk, who warned of the ""destabilising"" effect of uncertainty over the UK's future in Europe in a letter to fellow EU leaders this week.
Mr Osborne said the UK had received the ""lion's share"" of EU investment since announcing its EU referendum plans.
George Osborne went on to say ""someone called Tony"" has been writing today, referred her to comments from former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, who said in an interview published today that the current state of the party was a complete ""tragedy"".
Ms Eagle, who is shadow business secretary, was ready with an alternative Blair quote: ""Just mouth the words five more Tory years and you feel your senses and reasons repulsed by what they've done to our country.""
David Cameron is visiting Romania and Poland, so the chancellor - who is PMQs deputy by virtue of also having the First Secretary of State title - stepped up for his second appearance at the despatch box.
Meanwhile Ms Eagle, who is shadow business secretary, was also given the shadow First Secretary of State title in Jeremy Corbyn's first shadow cabinet. This means she gets the job of deputising for her leader on such occasions, and this was her first opportunity since getting the role.
Mr Osborne was given a promotion at the end of the session by Tory backbencher Peter Bone, who called him the ""acting prime minister"".
Ms Eagle dedicated her opening questions to the flooding that has hit North West England, asking the chancellor to guarantee that money would be ""no object"" in the relief effort. In his response, Mr Osborne pledged £50m fund for families and businesses that have been affected.

US tycoon and presidential hopeful Donald Trump's call for a temporary halt on Muslims entering the United States did not go unnoticed by MPs, as a petition calling for him to be banned from the UK passed 100,000 signatures.
This means it must be considered for a debate in Parliament. SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh urged Mr Osborne to back the move, while Labour MP Stephen Timms asked him to to respond to Mr Trump's ""bizarre claims"".
The chancellor said the Republican was ""profoundly wrong"" but batted away calls for a ban, saying his views should instead be tackled through ""robust democratic argument"".

37082760,"Jedburgh became the latest town to receive the provision last week.
Councillor Stewart Bell said by the end of the latest rollout, 94% of homes in the region should have access.
He added that a range of groups were working on ways to deliver superfast services to those not covered by that programme.
There have been concerns in the past that the region was missing out despite major investment in broadband.
Mr Bell said there were technical reasons why some sites would not see their services improve.
""Over very long distances the speeds run down a bit and therefore there are some premises that are very distant from cabinets that won't see a significant improvement in services,"" he said.
""The target for this superfast scheme which will be fully operational between 2017 and 2018 is to get 94% of premises in the Borders connected.
""The remaining 6% is something that is being considered by Digital Scotland and Community Broadband Scotland in co-operation with local authorities to see if we can come up with customised local solutions.""",A Borders councillor has said work is being done to deliver superfast broadband to homes in the region currently missing out on the service.
38902480,"The Met, the largest force, topped the list, spending £5.2m from 2011-16, the data showed.
One critic said it did not stop the ""cycle of crime"", however, the National Police Chiefs' Council said it was ""a cost effective tactic"".
A Home Office spokesman said it was ""an operational matter for police"".
Informants can get anything from a few pounds for basic information, up to several thousand pounds for helping break up organised crime.
Payments are typically used to solve - or prevent - crimes including murder, terrorism and serious sexual offences, and can also be made to recover valuable stolen items.
Ronnie Howard, a former undercover police officer, said he made regular payments to informants, and in one case paid out £15,000 over 12 months in order to recover £3m worth of cannabis.
He said informants were usually recruited after being arrested and offered either money or a possible sentencing deal in court in return for information supplied.
Figures obtained by 5 live Breakfast, under a freedom of information request revealed 41 forces in England and Wales collectively paid £19.59m to informants between 2011 and 2016.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland spent almost £2m during the same period while Police Scotland, who only released figures for 2013-16, revealed it had spent £565,248.
There are no statistics available to show how many convictions have come as a result of paying informants - or covert human intelligence sources as they are officially known - but the National Police Chiefs' Council defended the practice.
Deputy Chief Constable Roger Bannister said: ""The intelligence provided helps to prevent and solve the most serious of crimes and is vital in bringing offenders to justice through the courts.
""This is a well-established and highly regulated, worthwhile, and cost effective tactic, with the money paid to informants being very closely scrutinised.""
But, Neil Wood, who worked as an undercover police officer and ran many informants, said the tactic has its limitations.
""It can be effective for certain crimes but for others - such as the war on drugs - using informants merely ensures that the cycle of violence and brutality continues,"" he said.
""Nobody wants to inform on the drug lords because of fears of violent reprisals, so it's only the low-lying fruit that gets caught out - and the trade continues regardless.
""Nobody can call that effective. Overall it does little to bring down the level of overall crime.""
Of those which responded, 39 forces in England and Wales provided annual breakdowns, which suggested payments had fallen from £4.1m in 2011/12 to just over £3.1m last year.
North Wales Police paid out the smallest amount, handing over just under £40,000 over five years.
South Yorkshire Police and Cleveland Police did not provide figures.
Police forces are audited on their use of informants and are inspected annually by the Office of Surveillance Commissioners to ensure they are not breaking the law.
A Home Office spokesman said decisions on the operational deployment of resources ""are matters for chief constables"", adding: ""There is no question that the police still have the resources to do their important work.
""We have provided a fair provisional funding deal for 2017/18.
""It provides stable funding for the police and enables essential policing reform and transformation to go further and faster so that we help the vulnerable, cut crime and support our communities.""","Police forces across the UK paid out at least £22m to informants over the last five years, according to figures obtained by BBC Radio 5 live."
29194220,"However, Better Together leader Alistair Darling said ""there is no way back"" from independence and his campaign would target undecided voters.
The latest opinion polls have suggested the vote is too close to call.
Both men were speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr show.
Mr Salmond said: ""We're not aiming to win by one vote. We're aiming to achieve a substantial majority if we can.""
He added: ""We tend to take the attitude that there isn't so much as a 'No' voter in Scotland, there are only deferred 'Yeses', and that's been one of the successes of our campaign.""
Asked if he would seek another referendum if there was a ""No"" vote on Thursday, the SNP leader said: ""If you remember that previous constitutional referendum in Scotland - there was one in 1979 and then the next one was 1997.
""That's what I mean by a political generation.
""In my opinion, and it is just my opinion, this is a once in a generation opportunity for Scotland.""
Mr Darling commented: ""I said a year ago that this race would narrow as we got towards the wire and that is precisely what has happened.
""It's not surprising. It's the biggest single decision we will ever take.
""If we vote to leave the UK on Thursday then there's no going back. It's not like an election where you can change your mind if things don't work out.
""If things go wrong this time, we've already voted - we're leaving.
""There is no way back, which is why in the next five days we will be targeting the 500,000 or so voters who have still got to make their minds up, because the decision is that critical.""
He argued there was uncertainty over whether firms would move their headquarters out of Scotland and over how the NHS and pensions would be funded if the country became independent.
And he argued that ""about a million jobs here in Scotland depend on us being part of the UK"".
Mr Salmond told the Andrew Marr programme that if ""Yes"" won there would ""cease to be a 'Yes' campaign and a 'No' campaign - there will be a Team Scotland"".
He said he wanted ""as many voices as possible"" and welcomed an indication from Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael last month that he would join such a negotiating team.
Mr Salmond said his negotiating team had ""recruited specialism in a variety of fields"".
The first minister renewed his claim that the Bank of England would be ""a shared central bank"" after independence.
""There will be a sustainability agreement between the governments in terms of borrowing levels and debt levels,"" he said.
""We set that out in our proposals.""
The UK government has said it would not agree to a currency union with an independent Scotland, but Mr Salmond argued American economist Joseph Stiglitz had said ""a shared currency is a very, very viable and common sense thing to do"".
Meanwhile, Mr Darling again said the pro-Union parties would deliver more powers for the Scottish Parliament if there was a ""No"" vote.
""It's quite a clear choice now,"" he said.
""We can have faster, safer and better change, reform so that we can strengthen the health service, we can safeguard jobs.
""But you don't have the risks that come with independence, to jobs, to the funding of pensions and the health service, the uncertainty about currency.""
Pressed on whether details of more powers would be available ahead of the vote, the Better Together leader said: ""What has been agreed is the timetable that will bring together the proposals made by the three non-nationalist parties.
""Now that's abundantly clear that we will be able to start that process on Friday, if we vote to stay in the United Kingdom.""
The interviews came after Yes Scotland campaigners claimed their private canvassing showed ""the votes are there for a 'Yes' majority"".
However, Better Together said the ""No"" vote was ""holding up"".
Three polls have put the ""No"" campaign in the lead, while one has put the pro-independence ""Yes"" campaign ahead.
The latest poll of polls collating the six most recent surveys - carried out between 9 and 12 September and excluding ""don't knows"" - puts the ""No"" campaign on 51% and the ""Yes"" campaign on 49%.
The pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign has not revealed the number of people it has talked to during its private canvassing, but claimed to have achieved a higher return than ever before.
Better Together campaign director Blair McDougall said polls showed the referendum vote was ""on a knife-edge"".
Better Together published a poll on Saturday suggesting 53.5% opposed independence and 46.5% backed it, when undecided voters were excluded.
The telephone poll, commissioned by Better Together from pollsters Survation, reached 1,044 respondents, with an effective sample size of 927.
Conducted between 10 and 12 September, it also pointed to a very high turnout, with 93% of voters surveyed saying they are certain to vote.
Another poll for the Observer newspaper, gave the ""No"" campaign a six point lead - 53% to the pro-independence campaign's 47%.
And a new Sunday Times poll - conducted by Panelbase - puts the voters who intended to vote ""No"" on 50.6% while the ""Yes"" campaign was on 49.4%.
However, an ICM poll for the Sunday Telegraph has suggested Scotland could become independent, putting the ""Yes"" camp in the lead. Excluding undecided voters it found ""Yes"" to be on 54% and ""No"" on 46%.
The poll was carried out between 10 and 12 September and had a sample size of 705 - smaller than many of the other polls.
A referendum on whether Scotland should become independent is to take place
Meanwhile, a leading economist has said there is ""little basis"" for ""fear-mongering"" over the economy of an independent Scotland.
Joseph Stiglitz countered the view of fellow Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, who recently warned that Scotland would face ""huge risks"" going it alone and told Scots to ""be very afraid"".
Mr Stiglitz said that while there would be risks in the event of a Yes vote, the risks of Scotland remaining in the union and UK leaving the EU would be ""significantly greater"".
In an article published in the Sunday Herald and the Scotsman, he urged Scots to focus on ""vision and values"" in the last few days before the crucial vote.
He said: ""Krugman, for instance, suggests that there are significant economies of scale: a small economy is likely, he seems to suggest, not to do well.
""But an independent Scotland will still be part of Europe, and the great success of the EU is the creation of a large economic zone.
""By an order of magnitude, far more important than size is the pursuit of the right policies.""","Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond said the independence referendum was ""a once in a generation opportunity"" and he was aiming for ""a substantial majority""."
26382532,"Seven people were charged with stealing and conspiracy to steal a baby from the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital earlier in February.
Suwaiba Mumuni, whose baby is among the five missing, told the BBC she believes her child is still alive.
The hospital, the second largest in Ghana, has denied the allegations.
The BBC's Sammy Darko in the capital, Accra, says the case of the missing babies has caused outrage in Ghana.
Youths stormed the hospital in Kumasi, 270km (167 miles) north-west of Accra, on Thursday, temporarily closing the maternity wards, he says.
Ms Mumuni said after she gave birth on 5 February, she was told that her baby was stillborn and it was taken away by attendants.
When her relatives arrived later in the day to collect the body for burial, it could not be found, she said.
""The only news I am expecting to hear is that my baby has been found,"" Ms Mumuni told the BBC.
""They told me my baby is dead, but they have not been able to produce the body... I am confident my baby is alive.""
The bodies of another four babies allegedly delivered stillborn that day are also missing.
""The ministry will leave no stone unturned until the truth is established,"" Health Minister Sherry Ayittey said in a statement.
Ms Ayittey said the hospital had 14 working days to find the bodies of the babies ""for burial by the families"".
Staff at the hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they often felt overwhelmed and there were inadequate resources to deal with demand.
Our reporter says the seven people charged on Thursday over Ms Mumuni's missing baby were given bail.",Ghana's health minister has given a hospital in the city of Kumasi 14 days to produce the bodies of five babies that were allegedly stillborn.
36528196,"The site owned by Global Energy Group joins Wick Harbour in Caithness in securing work on the Â£2.6bn Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd (Bowl) project.
Siemens, one of the companies involved in Bowl, will use the yard for assembling turbines from spring 2018.
Once assembled the turbines would be towed out to the wind farm site.
The project, which also involves energy giant SSE, is to be created about eight miles off Wick.
Global said Nigg's involvement would help to secure work for more than 100 people.
The Scottish government, Highland Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Scottish Council for Development and Industry (SCDI) and Scottish Renewables have welcomed the announcement.
Business, Innovation and Energy Minister, Paul Wheelhouse, said: ""Offshore renewables represent a huge opportunity for Scotland; an opportunity to build up new industries and to deliver on Scotland's ambitious renewable energy and carbon reduction targets for 2020 and beyond.
""I am delighted that this multi-million pound contract between Global Energy Group and Siemens will enable Nigg Energy Park to develop into a genuine multi-energy site, securing around 100 direct and indirect jobs and associated supply chain opportunities.
""This contract arising from installation of the Beatrice Offshore Wind farm will provide a very welcome boost to the local economy in Ross-shire and the wider Highland Council area.""
Regional director for the Highlands and Islands, Fraser Grieve, said: ""Today's announcement of Nigg's involvement in the Beatrice Offshore wind project shows the positive economic impact that this major development will have on the region over the coming years.
""Nigg, and the wider Cromarty Firth, has much to offer and this agreement is not only a boost for the Global Energy Group but will benefit the supply chain through the area.""
Lindsay Roberts, senior policy manager at renewable energy industry group Scottish Renewables, said: ""The contract signed today will help breathe new life into this Highland port.
""Scotland's offshore wind industry has huge potential for both our economy and our environment, and it's great to see Nigg reaping the benefits.
""As other wind farms with planning consent in the Scottish North Sea begin to develop, agreements like this will play a key role in securing benefits not just for communities on the east coast, but for the whole of Scotland.""",The Nigg Energy Park on the Cromarty Firth is to be used during construction of an 84-turbine offshore wind farm.
32072218,"Their evidence, obtained from the cockpit voice recorder and other information outlines in more detail how co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28, brought down the Airbus.
So how did this final half hour unfold?
Germanwings flight 4U 9525 took off from Barcelona Airport in Spain heading for Duesseldorf, Germany, with 150 people on board, at 09:00 GMT on 24 March.
The Airbus 320 began travelling over the sea towards France, taking about half an hour to climb to 38,000ft (11,600m).
It should have been a two-hour flight and, in the first 20 minutes, the pilots could be heard discussing the stop-over at Barcelona with a flight attendant.
At 09:30 the plane made its final contact with air traffic control - a routine message about permission to continue on its route. Everything seemed to be going as planned.
Shortly afterwards, the captain told the co-pilot he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications. The cockpit door is heard opening and closing on the recording.
Seconds later, shortly before 09:31, the selected altitude was changed from 38,000 ft to 100 ft and the plane began its descent.
At 09:33, the plane's speed increased. Air traffic control contacted the co-pilot - and continued to do so over the coming minutes - but received no answer.
A buzzer requesting access to the cockpit sounded at 09:34. Knocking and muffled voices asking for the door to be opened  can be heard until the end of the recording.
At 09:39, ""noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions"" over the course of a minute. The flight crew of another plane also tried to make contact with the cockpit by radio around this time.
In the next minute - 93 seconds before impact - ""low amplitude inputs"" on the co-pilot's flight controls were recorded. But the level of movement was too low to disengage the autopilot, so the input made no change to the flight path.
The ""Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up, Pull up"" warning was triggered at 09:40: 41 and it continues until the end of the recording at 09:41:06.
French prosecutor Brice Robin gave details of events on board the Airbus when he briefed journalists after the cockpit voice recorder was analysed in the days after the crash.
During the first 20 minutes of the flight, he said, the co-pilot's responses were courteous but he became ""curt"" when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing.
It was shortly after this that the captain left the cockpit, probably to go to the toilet, and within seconds Lubitz had altered the flight monitoring system to send the aircraft into descent.
""This action on the altitude controls can only be deliberate,"" said Mr Robin.
In the 10 minutes it took for the plane to plummet through the sky, Lubitz did not say a word and his breathing remained normal - despite repeated attempts by crew members and air traffic control to get him to respond.
The Airbus descended at a rate of about 3-4,000ft per minute. The last radar contact was at 09.40:47 GMT at 6,175ft.
During the very last moment of the recording passengers can be heard screaming. Mr Robin said he believed they were unaware of what was happening in the cockpit up until this point.
The plane hit the mountain at 700km/h (430mph) an hour.  ""Death was instant,"" he added.","French accident investigators released their final report into Germanwings Flight 4U 9525, which crashed in the Alps in March 2015, about a year later."
33514194,"A video of the 13-year-old's murder has gone viral on social media.
The killers accused the boy of trying to steal a bicycle rickshaw van in the north-eastern city of Sylhet.
Three people have been detained, including the main suspect who fled to Saudi Arabia after the attack.
Suspected thieves are often attacked by mobs in Bangladesh.
But the BBC's South Asia editor, Joanna Jolly, says that the brutality of the assault has caused widespread outrage and led to police forming a special squad to investigate the killing.
One of the attackers filmed the assault on Samiul Alam Rajon on Wednesday on his mobile phone, while the others tied the boy to a pole and hit him repeatedly with a metal rod.
He screamed for help, the Daily Star reported, and cried for water as he begged for his life.
The men can be heard laughing and jeering at him as they told him that they would post the video on Facebook.
After the boy was killed, the attackers took his body to a secluded dump, the paper reported, about 600ft (180m) away from the torture spot.
But they were spotted by some locals who chased them. Three of the group escaped, but one man was caught and handed over to the police. Another was later detained, while the main suspect was arrested in Saudi Arabia.
""It's a sad and unfortunate incident,"" Bangladesh's Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal was quoted by bdnews.24 as saying. ""One [man] has been remanded and another has been arrested. The rest will be arrested soon. None will be spared.""
An autopsy report said that Samiul - who helped his family to sell vegetables - died of a brain haemorrhage after sustaining head injuries. More than 60 injury marks were found on his body. A Twitter page in his honour has been set up.",Thousands of people in Bangladesh are demanding justice for a teenage boy who was beaten to death by a group of men who filmed themselves laughing and jeering as they carried out the attack.
40682982,"Now, on the surface, these words from Michael Gove shouldn't be surprising. A minister wouldn't advertise disunity.
The surprise though is that - as one of the most prominent Leave campaigners - he was talking about an implementation period post-Brexit which could last for an unspecified amount of time.
Insiders say his arrival at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and dealing with the powerful farming lobby may have influenced his view.
Some of the most prominent Remain ministers have been expressing relief - tinged in one case with just a hint of triumphalism - that they think in recent weeks that they have managed to sell the idea of a soft landing -  or as some say ""no cliff edge"" - after the UK leaves the EU in 2019 to some of their more sceptical colleagues.
So much for unity. Where do differences still lie?
It was interesting that, in answering my question on whether freedom of movement would continue under an implementation period, that Michael Gove didn't rule this out. Migration, he argued, would be decided by the needs of the economy.
But for how long? The tectonic plates may have moved on a transitional deal but its duration is where cabinet fault lines persist.
Liam Fox has been pretty clear he doesn't want to contemplate anything more than two years.
As one minister put it - he has waited forty years to leave the EU so two more won't matter.
But anther prominent cabinet Brexiteer told me he thought it would be a ""disaster"" if the implementation period hadn't concluded by the assumed date of the next election in 2022 while others have talked about anything up to a four year period.
Then what form will any transition take?
Could there be temporary membership of the European Economic Area? Some leavers might be suspicious that temporary would become permanent.
Should we stay in the customs union a bit longer until we hammer out a bespoke deal post Brexit?
The EU is unlikely to get the clarity it seeks until there is clarity around the cabinet table.
So while some Remainer ministers I have spoken to this week were upbeat, relaxed and chipper - and believe that British business is making its influence felt - many issues remain unresolved.
And, of course, I use the term 'Remainer"" historically - the cabinet is also united on leaving the EU but the question is how.
There has been talk of soft, hard and clean Brexits. Increasingly another word has entered the lexicon.
David Davis uses it. Michael Gove used it today. Expect to hear more of it. Pragmatic. That's now the goal - a pragmatic Brexit. And that necessarily means compromise at cabinet level as well as with the EU.","The government and the cabinet ""is united""."
28982595,"After 100 minutes of gruelling rugby union in front of a packed Twickenham, Alex Waller's score in the final minute of extra-time was eventually allowed to stand and Jim Mallinder's side were left celebrating their maiden league crown.
On Friday night, Saints will embark on the defence of their trophy against Gloucester at Kingsholm, hoping to become only the third side to win successive titles in the play-off era.
It kicks off an exciting opening weekend of action, which sees last year's Premiership and Heineken Cup runners-up Saracens take on Wasps, before Harlequins play London Irish, in the London double header.
Elsewhere, Leicester Tigers, also denied by a late Northampton try in the play-off semi-finals, host Newcastle Falcons, and newly-promoted London Welsh kick off their return to the top flight with a home match against Exeter.
With a home World Cup starting in September 2015, this season could take on extra significance for those plying their trade in the Premiership as they look to muscle their way in on the action.
BBC Sport has teamed up with BBC local radio and experts for an at-a-glance guide to the campaign ahead.
BBC local radio will be providing live commentary of matches throughout the Premiership season, which you can access through the rugby union commentaries page.
How have Bath fared in the transfer market?
BBC Points West's Damian Derrick: ""Most significantly, Bath have the arrival of the hugely-talented Sam Burgess to look forward to. The West Country club's marquee signing from rugby league will certainly make an impact and could add yet another significant dimension.
""The recruitment otherwise has been low key and shows the faith head coach Mike Ford has in his players.""
What are their hopes and ambitions for the new season?
""Bath's biggest challenge may well be emulating their performances of 2013-14, with all the other teams now knowing what's coming. They made huge strides last season with new players and a developing style of play which surprised many in the rugby fraternity.
""However, they must start their campaign without two key members of a largely dominant pack. Matt Garvey misses the first couple of months, with a recurrence of the ankle injury that saw him miss the end of last season, and Francois Louw doesn't return from South Africa duty until October.
""Missing out on a top-four Premiership place and losing the European Challenge Cup final has been Bath's motivation over the summer to make that next step.""
Damian Derrick's Premiership prediction: Third
How have the Chiefs fared in the transfer market?
BBC Radio Devon's Nigel Walrond: ""The Chiefs have added three internationals to their squad to bolster hopes for the new season, with Scotland prop Moray Low arriving from Glasgow, former England number Thomas Waldrom from Leicester and Namibian full-back Chysander Botha from South African Super 15 franchise the Lions.
""Mitch Lees, Tomas Francis, Elvis Taione and Adam Hughes have also been picked up from Championship clubs.""
What are their hopes and ambitions for the new season? ""Exeter are looking to improve on their eighth-place finish last season, and hope the fact they are not in the top tier of European rugby this season will enable them to concentrate on the Premiership and put less pressure on their squad.
""One area they need to boost is their home form.""
Nigel Walrond's Premiership prediction: Seventh
How have Gloucester fared in the transfer market?
BBC Radio Gloucestershire's Paul Furley: ""Gloucester's recruitment for 2014-15 has been impressive, with high-profile signings in John Afoa, Richard Hibbard, Tom Palmer and Mariano Galarza boosting the front five where they were most exposed last season.
""The addition of international experience of Greig Laidlaw and James Hook should add class and control at half-back to unleash the Cherry and Whites' outside backs at the right time with quality possession.""
What are their hopes and ambitions for the new season?
""Despite all the signings, Gloucester are playing catch-up having sacked Nigel Davies at the end of last season, and taken their time to bring in David Humphreys as director of rugby and Lawrie Fisher as head coach.
""How they, plus other new coaches Nick Walshe and John Muggleton, adapt to working with a squad that they inherited from someone else's vision - and how the players adapt to what is asked of them - may prove to be Gloucester's biggest challenge.""
Paul Furley's Premiership prediction: Sixth
How have Quins fared in the transfer market?
BBC London 94.9's Sara Orchard: ""Once again Harlequins have remained quiet in the transfer market as director of rugby Conor O'Shea tinkers rather than transforms his squad.
""Only Northampton have made less signings as just two new Quins' faces arrive. England wing Marland Yarde made the short hop from London Irish, while Super 15 wing/centre Asaeli Tikoirotuma arrived from the Chiefs at the end of August.""
What are their hopes and ambitions for the new season?
""The 2013-14 season was the first for three years without silverware for the London outfit, but another Premiership top-four finish and reaching the knock-outs of Europe is well within the team's ability.
""The announcement of England prop Joe Marler as captain has raised eyebrows across the rugby community but O'Shea's man management has been pretty flawless throughout his tenure in south-west London. The decision to promote the 24-year-old is an exciting prospect for all Premiership fans - who could forget when Marler shaved a sausage company's name into his hair. Whether Chris Robshaw being relieved of the skipper's duties is right for him, his club and his country, won't be known until next year.""
Sara Orchard's Premiership prediction: Fourth
How have Tigers fared in the transfer market?
BBC Radio Leicester's Martin Ballard: ""Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill has been busy. Out go Toby Flood (Toulouse) George Chuter (retired), Thomas Waldrom (Exeter), Dan Bowden (Auckland Blues) and Steve Mafi (Western Force), along with a number of young developing players. In come a selection of experienced internationals, while Freddie Burns takes Flood's place.
""There are a number of former Treviso players; Leonardo Ghiraldini, Michele Rizzo, Robert Barbieri and Christian Loamanu. Add to that Seremaia Bai, Laurence Pearce and the latest recruit, All-Black legend Brad Thorn.""
What are their hopes and ambitions for the new season?
""After nine consecutive Premiership finals, the Tigers didn't make a single final last season - let alone win a trophy. So, their aspirations are to put that right at a club where the heritage is steeped in success and expectations are high.
""Cockerill has also recruited the Australian Rugby League legend Phil Blake as their new defence coach to correct an area of their game which was regarded as a weakness last season.
""The Tigers are a top-four team and they would expect to qualify for the Premiership semi-finals again. It will be very competitive at the top of the table again, but I think the top two will be between Saracens, Tigers and Saints.""
Martin Ballard's Premiership prediction: First
How have London Irish fared in the transfer market?
BBC Radio Berkshire's Chris Egerton: ""London Irish were desperately short of power and depth up front last season which is reflected in the summer arrivals. International props in the form of Ireland's Tom Court (Ulster) and Scotland's Geoff Cross (Edinburgh) may prove to be their shrewdest signings.
""But the loss of England wing Marland Yarde to Harlequins is bound to hurt. James O'Connor's departure to Toulon less so.""
What are their hopes and ambitions for the new season?
""There's more of a feel-good factor at London Irish. With new owners on board and a new training complex up and running, the Exiles could be more competitive this year.
""How much they improve compared to Exeter, Gloucester, Wasps and Sale is hard to predict, but Irish hopes of Champions Cup qualification are not without foundation.""
Chris Egerton's Premiership prediction: Seventh
How have London Welsh fared in the transfer market?
BBC Sport's Nabil Hassan: ""Championship play-off winners London Welsh have made 25 new signings for their return to the top flight. Yes, that's right, 25. Among them are New Zealand's former World Cup winning scrum-half Piri Weepu and ex-England outside half Olly Barkley.
""Australian back-row forward Lachlan McCaffrey and Argentina prop Pablo Henn are another two new signings who will help strengthen the pack.""
What are their hopes and ambitions for the new season? ""Having been relegated two seasons ago, privately London Welsh will be delighted with avoiding relegation this campaign, but publicly they are setting their sights a lot higher.
""'We want to do ourselves proud, we're not here only to survive,' Welsh head coach Justin Burnell told me last week.""
Nabil Hassan's Premiership prediction: 11th
How have the Falcons fared in the transfer market?
BBC Newcastle's Ian Smith: ""The Falcons have been active in bringing new blood to Kingston Park, both on and off the field.
""Off the field John Wells moves up to head the coaching staff and Dave Walder has been brought in to share his experience as a top quality fly-half and help create a style of rugby that will hopefully take advantage of the new Kingston Park plastic pitch.
""On the field the squad has been bolstered by the addition of 10 players. Current Italian international Josh Furno is the standout signing in the pack but it is the arrival of Tuilagi brothers Alex and Andy that has raised eyebrows and also expectations on Tyneside. Alex is the star attraction having scored 46 Premiership and 15 Heineken Cup tries in his eight seasons in England's top flight, but at 33 years of age and having spent the last two seasons in Japan, the Kingston Park faithful will hope that his body does not give up.
""The Falcons squad looks stronger than last year but fly-half is still a concern.""
What are their hopes and ambitions for the new season?
""Newcastle's first season back in the Premiership was a success in as much as they did not finish bottom. The run of 16 successive defeats is the worst in Newcastle's history, and everyone involved with the club will have fingers crossed that can be halted.
""Last season the poor condition of the Kingston Park pitch was highlighted as a major factor in producing some rather uninspiring rugby, but that problem is no more as a new plastic surface awaits the boots of the new season's protagonists. It will be interesting to see if the pitch benefits the Falcons and their much talked about change of playing style - or enable the opposition to move further away.
""Ambitions at Kingston Park will again be survival.""
Ian Smith's Premiership prediction: 11th
How have Saints fared in the transfer market?
BBC Radio Northampton's Ian Hunter: ""Fly-half Joel Hodgson is one of champions Saints' two signings this summer - the other being back-row Jon Fisher - and director of rugby Jim Mallinder is looking at the former for the nine spot, but I cannot see that improving on Kahn Fotuali'i and Lee Dickson.
""Last year was great for young player development. Saints were able to bring players through players including Tom Stephenson, Tom Collins, Will Hooley, James Craig, Mike Haywood, Alex and Ethan Waller and I expect a number of them to push for regular places this season.
""Where could they add strength? A world-class right-winger wouldn't go amiss - power, searing pace or both is always difficult to defend against. Jamie Elliot and Ken Pisi are quality players and I'm nit-picking for the best. A concern I do have is an understudy to fly-half Steven Myler. We saw how much Saints missed him last year when he was out.""
What are their hopes and ambitions for the new season? ""They came into last season as the nearly men but they managed to shake that title. Mallinder will not want that to be a one-off. That is why this year is even more important to the future of the club and this group of players.
""Another successful season will project Northampton from a good club to a great one, or at least going in that direction. With success comes the ease of retaining and attracting talent on the pitch, and off it the commercial upshot of more lucrative sponsorship deals.
""Mallinder will definitely have one eye on the European Rugby Champions Cup. The Saints have a very good draw and a great shot of throwing their hat in the ring for the final rounds. League and European glory? That might be a bridge too far but Mallinder will be disappointed if he doesn't get one of them. That's his ambition - and mine.""
Ian Hunter's Premiership prediction: First
How have Sale fared in the transfer market?
BBC Radio Manchester's Nathan Middleton: ""After losing some of their young English talent over the summer, Steve Diamond has replaced them with proven internationals, with Nathan Hines, Luke McLean and Alberto de Marchi joining. Elsewhere, Chris Cusiter is a more than able replacement for the departing Dwayne Peel at scrum-half and Magnus Lund could be one of the Premiership's most inspired signings.""
What are their hopes and ambitions for the new season?
""Sale will be looking to push on from their top-half finish last season and have ambitions of getting into the top four, which they had a sniff at in the closing months of the last campaign.
""The Sharks will ultimately be looking to finish sixth or better again but have targeted beating more of the top sides, as well as being competitive in their difficult European Rugby Champions Cup group.""
Nathan Middleton's Premiership prediction: Sixth
How have Sarries fared in the transfer market?
BBC London 94.9's Andrew Rowley: ""It has been a quieter summer by the standards of recent years at Saracens. Last year's runners-up have bid farewell to some big players, such as Steve Borthwick and Matt Stevens, and will hope Scotland international Jim Hamilton and Argentina's Juan Figallo can step into the breach.
""Prop Kieran Longbottom arrives from Western Force and they have also recruited Mike Ellery from England Sevens. The injury to Mako Vunipola is a blow but they have the cover.""
What are their hopes and ambitions for the new season?
""Saracens enter every tournament with the ambition to win it, as demonstrated by their final appearances in both the Premiership and Heineken Cup last season. It would be a huge shock if they are not in the mix for both competitions again come May next year.
""It will rankle with the leaders at the club that for all the impressive progress on and off the field in the last few years, the 2011-12 Premiership title is still the only trophy to show for all their hard work and investment.
""Last season they recorded a record points total in the regular Premiership season and I can see them finishing top of the pile again. Then it is about managing their resources if they are battling on two fronts again.""
Andrew Rowley's Premiership prediction: First
How have Wasps fared in the transfer market?
BBC London 94.9's Sara Orchard: ""The Wasps HR department have been pretty busy as director of rugby Dai Young sees 13 players depart and 12 arrive. While the loss of Tom Palmer (Gloucester) and Charlie Hayter (England Sevens) will be felt, there's plenty of incoming talent.
""The arrival of Sale's James Gaskell could see a formidable second-row partnership built with Joe Launchbury. Keep an eye out for Scotland's Ruaridh Jackson pushing Andy Goode at fly-half, along with Hurricanes Super 15 import Alapati Leiua causing chaos across the backline.""
What are their hopes and ambitions for the new season?
""Wasps' potential has never quite been realised in recent seasons because of their ongoing medical bill.
""Seeing both Tom Varndell and Christian Wade as regulars on the team sheet should do wonders for the fans' nerves. If they pick up this season where they left off the last - doing the double over Stade Francais to secure the last European Rugby Champions Cup spot - this maturing team will cause problems for others in all competitions.
""Dai Young will have been hard pressed to ignore the number of points scored against them in their 2013-14 campaign and no doubt attention will have been paid to tighten up their defence. The announcement of 'The Brand' James Haskell as captain has been hugely popular with the Wasps fans, as the England flanker leads by example on the pitch. He'll be looking to impress for his club to hopefully force the issue of selection for his country, with the 2015 World Cup now in touching distance.""
Sara Orchard's Premiership prediction: Sixth",It seems like only yesterday that television match official Graham Hughes was deliberating over whether to award the try that would win Northampton the Premiership title at Rugby HQ.
36132470,"Mark Gourley, from the Castlemara estate in Carrickfergus, was reported missing in March 2009. He was last seen in the Burney's Lane area of Glengormley.
In 2013, police investigating the 36-year-old's disappearance said they had begun a murder inquiry.
On Monday, two men, aged 45 and 43, were arrested in Carrickfergus.
The pair were released on police bail on Monday night pending further enquiries.
The body of Mr Gourley, who was described by police as a ""vulnerable individual"" who had been on medication at the time of his disappearance, has never been found.
Det Insp Darren McCartney appealed to anyone who may have information about Mark's disappearance or who may have seen Mark on or after 7 March 2009 to contact police.
""Previous appeals for information did generate reports of sightings but the last definite sighting of Mark was at 2.30pm on 7 March 2009 in the Burney's Lane area of Glengormley,"" he said.
""Mark did not have a mobile phone or a significant amount of money with him when he disappeared.""
Police said although Mr Gourley was last seen in the Glengormley area, he was from the Castlemara area of Carrickfergus and he may have returned to that area on 7 March 2009.
""Police are asking for anyone who may have noticed vehicles or individuals acting suspiciously in either the Burney's Lane area of Glengormley or in the Castlemara area of Carrickfergus around 7 March 2009 to contact police on the non-emergency number 101,"" Det Insp McCartney said.
""I believe there are people in these communities who have knowledge of what happened to Mark.
""Additionally, people may have heard rumours about what happened to Mark. I would appeal to them to share this information with police.
""If anyone has information about him, I would ask them to examine their conscience and come forward to police.""
Mr Gourley was about 5ft, 9"" tall, described as well-built, with fair, cropped hair, and an eyebrow bolt in his right eyebrow.
At the time of his disappearance, was wearing a black, zipped jacket with a grey motif on the back of the shoulders, dark Umbro tracksuit bottoms, black trainers and may have been wearing a blue Glasgow Rangers woollen hat.","Two men, who were arrested in connection with the murder of a missing County Antrim man, have been released."
35420579,"The Chinese game is viewed as a much tougher challenge than chess for computers because there are many more ways a Go match can play out.
The tech company's DeepMind division said its software had beaten its human rival five games to nil.
One independent expert called it a breakthrough for AI with potentially far-reaching consequences.
The achievement was announced to coincide with the publication of a paper, in the scientific journal Nature, detailing the techniques used.
Earlier on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive had said its own AI project had been ""getting close"" to beating humans at Go.
But the research he referred to indicated its software was ranked only as an ""advanced amateur"" and not a ""professional level"" player.
Go is thought to date back to ancient China, several thousand years ago.
Using black-and-white stones on a grid, players gain the upper hand by surrounding their opponents pieces with their own.
The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves compared with about 20 in chess.
There are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe, according to DeepMind's team.
It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct.
DeepMind's chief executive, Demis Hassabis, said its AlphaGo software followed a three-stage process, which began with making it analyse 30 million moves from games played by humans.
""It starts off by looking at professional games,"" he said.
""It learns what patterns generally occur - what sort are good and what sort are bad. If you like, that's the part of the program that learns the intuitive part of Go.
""It now plays different versions of itself millions and millions of times, and each time it gets incrementally better. It learns from its mistakes.
""The final step is known as the Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is really the planning stage.
""Now it has all the intuitive knowledge about which positions are good in Go, it can make long-range plans.""
Tested against rival Go-playing AIs, Google's system won 499 out of 500 matches,
And last October, DeepMind invited Fan Hui, Europe's top player, to its London office for a series of games, each of which the AI won.
""Many of the best programmers in the world were asked last year how long it would take for a program to beat a top professional, and most of them were predicting 10-plus years,"" Mr Hassabis said.
""The reasons it was quicker than people expected was the pace of the innovation going on with the underlying algorithms and also how much more potential you can get by combining different algorithms together.""
Prof Zoubin Ghahramani, of the University of Cambridge, said: ""This is certainly a major breakthrough for AI, with wider implications.
""The technical idea that underlies it is the idea of reinforcement learning - getting computers to learn to improve their behaviour to achieve goals.
""That could be used for decision-making problems - to help doctors make treatment plans, for example, in businesses or anywhere where you'd like to have computers assist humans in decision making.
""It doesn't mean that Google is ahead of all other companies in AI - there are many artificial intelligences.
""But in terms of devoting resources to Go, Google has clearly done more.
""Facebook has achieved some pretty spectacular results in other areas of artificial intelligence, but I think Google has beaten them to this particularly important challenge.""
DeepMind now intends to pit AlphaGo against Lee Sedol - the world's top Go player - in Seoul in March.
In addition, it continues to develop AI systems that can play computer games without any help, following last year's success at getting its bots to teach themselves how to play several dozen classics.
""For us, Go is the pinnacle of board game challenges,"" said Mr Hassabis.
""Now, we are moving towards 3D games or simulations that are much more like the real world rather than the Atari games we tackled last year. """,A Google artificial intelligence program has beaten the European champion of the board game Go.
34062741,"A skeleton of a meat-eating Jurassic dinosaur, the theropod, was uncovered by spring storms at Lavernock beach, Vale of Glamorgan, in 2014.
The dinosaur's missing foot was found at the beach by palaeontology student, Sam Davies, of Bridgend, at the beginning of this month.
""My first reaction was that I was very lucky,"" he said.
The fossilised skeleton of the theropod - a distant cousin of the giant Tyrannosaurus rex - went on display at the National Museum Cardiff's main hall in June after it was found by fossil-hunting brothers Nick and Rob Hanigan.
Mr Davies, who studies at the University of Portsmouth, visited Lavernock, near Penarth, after his tutor told him its cliffs were rich with fossils.
He arrived only hours after a cliff fall had exposed the fossil and before it could be washed away by the tide.
""It was pure luck that I found it. It was just sitting on top of a slab of rock,"" he said.
His tutor, Dr David Martill, confirmed the find was the missing foot of the recently discovered dinosaur, after the student emailed a picture.
Dr Martill said: ""This was a chance-in-a-million find and highlights how important it is to encourage fossil hunting in this country.""
He said the specimen would help chart the evolution of dinosaur feet.
The foot has been donated to the Amgueddfa Cymru, which hopes to put it
